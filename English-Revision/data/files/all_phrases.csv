1,"I work in aviation, but the truth is",1
2,I don't much like flying.,1
3,Current commercial flights,1
6,and use ancient plane designs,1
7,that have hardly changed from the 1950s.,1
8,It also represents my biggest,1
9,"personal impact on the environment,",1
10,just as it does for many of us,1
11,who fly multiple times a year.,1
12,Aviation will continue,1
13,to face fierce headwinds globally,1
14,"even after the pandemic subsides,",1
15,because flying is becoming the symbol,1
16,of a polluting lifestyle.,1
17,Pressure is growing to decarbonize planes,1
18,or even cease flying altogether.,1
19,But the great news is,1
20,that a change which will reroute,1
21,our industry's flight path,1
22,into fresh tailwinds,1
23,has already begun and is gathering speed.,1
24,This change is the third revolution,1
25,"in aviation — electrification,",1
26,and it is happening right now.,1
27,Like the previous,1
28,"piston and jet revolutions,",1
29,going electric will dramatically,1
30,transform the way we fly.,1
31,Electrification promises to make flying,1
32,accessible to more people globally,1
33,from more airports,1
34,"while also making planes cleaner,",1
35,quieter and more affordable.,1
36,The current dominant narrative,1
37,is that we need to buy offsets,1
38,while waiting for some,1
39,miracle future clean fuel,1
40,and meanwhile keep cramming people,1
41,into tubes at increasingly congested hubs.,1
42,That fails to reckon,1
43,with the rapid progress,1
44,in electric technology,1
45,across nearly all other,1
46,forms of transportation.,1
47,So my answer in 2016,1
48,was to create a company called Ampaire,1
49,and develop an electric aircraft capable,1
50,of flying real routes for real airlines.,1
51,"And we have done so with this plane,",1
52,"the Electric EEL,",1
53,which first flew in 2019.,1
54,"In 2020, our second",1
55,generation of this plane,1
56,flew with an airline partner in Hawaii,1
57,demoing daily flight operations,1
58,"on one of their routes, a world first.",1
59,"Meanwhile, we're hard at work",1
60,"on the third generation of the EEL,",1
61,as well as scaling up to a much larger,1
63,with the help of NASA.,1
64,"Now, these aren't yet",1
65,fully electric planes.,1
67,And that's actually my point today,1
68,and why the current,1
69,dominant narrative misses the mark.,1
70,Electrification does not only,1
71,mean pure battery electric.,1
72,"That's just not possible yet,",1
73,when you need to carry,1
74,"passengers or cargo,",1
75,except for small trainer aircraft.,1
76,"Instead, our industry must start saving",1
77,massive amounts of fuel and emissions,1
79,the entire aviation ecosystem.,1
80,Electrifying aviation right now,1
81,means solar panels,1
82,"and battery backup systems at airports,",1
83,plugging planes into gate power,1
84,"instead of burning fuel,",1
85,electric taxi to the runway,1
86,as well as electric tugs,1
87,and ground equipment.,1
88,"For flight itself, electrification means",1
89,starting with small aircraft,1
90,and for planes,1
91,"of meaningful commercial size,",1
92,payload and range starting hybrid.,1
93,"Although hybrid isn't the ultimate goal,",1
94,it is critical to start right now,1
95,rather than waiting,1
96,for future batteries or future fuels.,1
97,Think of cars where we had a small Prius,1
98,decades before a large Tesla semitruck.,1
99,Small planes like Ampaires,1
100,are the proving grounds,1
101,"for electric technology,",1
102,"be it lighter high voltage cables,",1
103,better compact motors,1
104,or advanced power electronics,1
105,that are key to unlocking,1
107,in aircraft of all sizes.,1
108,"Electrification will permeate everything,",1
109,from jumbo jets,1
110,becoming more electric aircraft,1
111,to repowering island hopper prop planes.,1
112,"As batteries and electronics improve,",1
113,larger and larger aircraft,1
114,will get more and more electric over time.,1
115,This is not a pipe dream,1
116,but represents iteration,1
117,"along a practical,",1
118,cost effective and achievable,1
119,route into the future.,1
120,Ampaire is being joined by other companies,1
121,that are also striving,1
122,to transform aviation to a cleaner future.,1
123,"It's a revolution in the making,",1
124,building on technologies,1
125,"derived from electric ground transport,",1
126,inventing new solutions and taking them,1
127,higher and higher into the stratosphere.,1
130,the highest paid athlete in the world,2
131,was an Argentine footballer,2
132,named Lionel Messi.,2
133,And his talent?,2
134,Dribbling a ball down a pitch,2
135,and booting it past a goalkeeper.,2
136,It's a skill so revered by fans,2
137,"and corporate sponsors alike,",2
138,"that in 2019,",2
139,Messi took home 104 million dollars.,2
140,That's almost two million dollars,2
141,for every goal he scored in season.,2
142,He's a pretty spectacular athlete,2
143,by any standard.,2
144,But why is it Messi's particular,2
145,skills are so valuable?,2
146,"Sure, there are obvious answers.",2
147,We just have enormous respect,2
148,"for athletic prowess,",2
149,"we love human competition,",2
150,and sports unite generations.,2
151,You can enjoy watching soccer,2
152,with your grandfather,2
153,and your granddaughter alike.,2
154,"But growing up, I admired",2
155,a different sort of athlete.,2
156,I didn't just want,2
157,to bend it like Beckham.,2
158,I loved video games,2
159,and I was floored,2
160,by the intricate strategies,2
161,and precision reflexes,2
162,required to play them well.,2
163,"To me, they were equally admirable",2
164,to anything taking place in stadia,2
165,around the world.,2
166,And I still feel that way.,2
167,"Today, I still love video games,",2
168,I founded successful,2
169,companies in the space,2
170,and I've even written a book,2
171,about the industry.,2
172,"But most importantly,",2
173,"I've discovered I'm not alone,",2
174,"because as I've grown up, so has gaming.",2
175,"And today, millions of players",2
176,around the world,2
177,need to compete in gaming centers,2
178,"like this helix,",2
179,"and large gaming tournaments,",2
180,like the League of Legends,2
182,can reach over 100 million viewers online.,2
183,That's more than some Super Bowls.,2
184,And Lionel Messi isn’t the only pro,2
185,getting [paid] for his skills.,2
186,Top gaming teams can take home,2
187,15 million dollars or more,2
188,from a single tournament,2
189,like Dota's Invitational.,2
190,And all this is why,2
191,"traditional sports stars,",2
192,"from David Beckham to Shaquille O'Neal,",2
193,"are investing in competitive games,",2
194,"transforming our industry,",2
195,"now called esports,",2
196,into a 27-billion-dollar,2
197,"phenomenon, almost overnight.",2
198,"But despite all this,",2
199,the skills required to be a pro gamer,2
200,still don't get much respect.,2
201,Parents hound their gamer-loving kids,2
202,"to go outside, do something useful,",2
203,take up a real sport.,2
204,And I'm not saying,2
205,"that physical activity isn't important,",2
206,or that esports are somehow better,2
207,than traditional sports.,2
208,What I want to argue,2
209,is that it takes real skill,2
210,to be good at competitive video games.,2
211,So let's take a look at the skills,2
212,"required to win in Fortnite,",2
213,"League of Legends, Rocket League,",2
214,some of today's most popular esports.,2
215,"Now, all of these games",2
216,are very different.,2
217,League of Legends is about,2
218,controlling a magical champion,2
219,as they siege an opposing fortress,2
220,with spells and abilities.,2
221,Fortnite is about parachuting,2
222,into 100-person free-for-all,2
223,on a tropical island paradise,2
224,"and Rocket League is soccer with cars,",2
225,"which, while it may sound strange,",2
226,"I promise, is incredibly fun.",2
227,"And yet, all of these three esports,",2
228,"despite their differences,",2
229,"and most competitive games, actually",2
230,have three common categories of skill.,2
231,And I'm going to take you,2
232,through each in turn.,2
233,The first type of skill required,2
234,"to master esports is mechanical skill,",2
235,sometimes referred to as micro.,2
236,Mechanical skill governs activating,2
237,and aiming in-game abilities,2
238,with pixel-perfect accuracy.,2
239,And I'd most liken mechanical skill,2
240,to playing an instrument like piano.,2
241,There's a musical flow,2
242,and a timing to predict,2
243,in your opponent's actions and reactions.,2
244,"And crucially, just like piano,",2
245,top esports pros hit,2
246,dozens of keys at once.,2
247,"Gamers regularly achieve APMs,",2
248,"or actions per minute,",2
249,"of 300 or more,",2
250,which is roughly one command,2
251,every fifth of a second,2
252,and in particularly mechanically,2
255,top pros achieve,2
256,"APMs of 600 or more,",2
257,allowing them to literally control,2
258,entire armies one unit at a time.,2
259,To give you an idea of how,2
260,"difficult this is,",2
261,imagine a classic game like,2
262,Super Mario Brothers.,2
263,"But instead of controlling one Mario,",2
264,"there are now two hundred,",2
265,"and instead of playing on one screen,",2
266,"you're playing across dozens,",2
267,each set to a different level or stage.,2
268,"And now Mario can't just run or jump,",2
269,"but he has new powers,",2
270,"teleportations, cannon blast,",2
271,"things like that,",2
272,that have to be activated,2
273,with split-second timing.,2
274,"Yeah, it is really hard",2
275,to play mechanically demanding,2
276,esports like StarCraft well.,2
277,Now the second category,2
278,of skill required to master esports,2
279,"is strategic skill,",2
280,sometimes called macro.,2
281,And this governs the larger tactical,2
282,choices gamers make.,2
283,And I'd liken and strategic skill,2
284,to mastery of chess.,2
285,You have to plan attacks,2
287,and manipulate the digital,2
288,battlefield to your advantage.,2
289,"But crucially, unlike chess,",2
290,esports are constantly evolving.,2
291,A popular esport like Fortnite,2
292,can patch almost every week.,2
293,And even the most competitive esports,2
294,like Rainbow Six Siege,2
295,"update every quarter,",2
296,and these changes aren't just cosmetic.,2
297,"They introduce new abilities,",2
298,"new heroes, new maps.",2
299,Constant change requires adaptivity.,2
300,It asks esports pros to do more,2
301,than just practice,2
302,but to theorize and invent.,2
303,"Now, gamers call this constantly",2
304,evolving suite of strategies,2
305,"the meta, short for the """"metagame.""""",2
306,And it would be like if every few weeks,2
307,the rules of basketball,2
310,"are now worth five points,",2
311,or NBA pros can dribble out of bounds.,2
312,"If this happened,",2
313,basketball would permit,2
314,for new strategies to win games,2
315,and the teams that discovered,2
316,these new strategies first,2
317,"would have a big, if temporary, advantage.",2
318,And this is exactly,2
319,what happens in esports,2
320,every time there's a patch or update.,2
322,rewards its most creative,2
323,and unconventional thinkers,2
324,with free wins.,2
325,"Now, the last category of skill required",2
326,"to be good at esports is leadership,",2
327,sometimes referred to as shot calling.,2
328,Esports pros are constantly,2
329,in private voice-chat communications,2
330,"with their teammates,",2
331,supplemented by a system,2
332,of in-game pings.,2
333,This is what allows a team,2
334,of League of Legends pros,2
335,to coordinate a spectacular,2
336,"barrage of five-man ultimates,",2
337,flashing in to capitalize on a minor,2
338,mispositioning by their opponents.,2
339,And leadership skill is also what allows,2
340,game captains to rally their teammates,2
341,in moments of crisis,2
342,and inspire them to make,2
343,one last risky all-in assault,2
344,on the opposing base.,2
345,And I'd argue this is the same,2
346,type of leadership,2
347,exuded by executives,2
348,and team captains everywhere.,2
349,"It's the ability to seize opportunity,",2
350,clearly and decisively,2
352,and inspire others to follow your lead.,2
353,"And all these three categories of skill,",2
354,"mechanical, strategic and leadership,",2
355,they have a crucial element in common.,2
356,They're all almost entirely mental.,2
357,Unlike my ability to have a basketball,2
358,"career at five-foot-ten,",2
359,"esports doesn’t care how tall I am,",2
360,"what gender I identify as, how old I am.",2
361,"In fact, esports controllers",2
362,can even be adapted,2
363,to pros with unique physical needs.,2
364,"Look at gamers like """"Brolylegs""""",2
365,who can't move his arms or legs,2
366,"or """"Halfcoordinated,"""" who has limited",2
367,use of his right hand.,2
368,"And these pros don't just compete,",2
369,they set records.,2
370,"Now, I'm not here to argue that esports",2
371,is some sort of egalitarian paradise.,2
372,"Our industry has real issues to address,",2
373,"particularly around inclusivity for women,",2
374,marginalized groups and those without,2
375,equitable access to technology.,2
376,But just because esports,2
377,"has a long way to go,",2
378,doesn't mean its,2
379,skills don't deserve respect.,2
380,And what particularly bugs me,2
381,is how often we ascribe,2
382,such enormous value,2
383,to traditional athletic,2
384,talents off the field.,2
385,How many times have we been,2
386,"in a job interview setting, let's say,",2
387,"and heard somebody say something like,",2
388,"""""Well, John is a phenomenally",2
390,He was captain of his college,2
393,John is going to be,2
394,a great digital marketer,2
395,because he can hurl a ball,2
396,really far with a stick?,2
397,"Come on, we would not apply",2
398,that logic anywhere else.,2
399,"""""Stand aside, scientists,",2
400,Sarah is my choice,2
401,to repair this nuclear reactor.,2
402,"After all, she played varsity soccer.""""",2
403,"No, what we mean when we say",2
404,John or Sarah is phenomenally,2
405,qualified for a job,2
406,is that because of their experiences,2
407,"playing traditional sports,",2
408,they have developed traits,2
409,with real value in the workplace:,2
410,"diligence, perseverance, teamwork.",2
411,And think of how I've just,2
412,described esports to you.,2
413,"Doesn't it sound like mechanical skill,",2
414,"strategic skill, leadership,",2
415,wouldn't those develop all those,2
416,same traits too?,2
417,"And more to the point,",2
418,in today's fast-paced,2
420,I think I might rather have a pro gamer,2
421,on my team than a traditional athlete.,2
422,"After all, I know they can be charismatic",2
423,and decisive over voice chat,2
424,and I'm sure doing a lot of Zoom calls,2
425,today in my business.,2
426,So maybe now I've convinced you,2
427,that esports and video games,2
428,deserve a little more respect.,2
429,"But if not, let me try to make",2
430,one last final appeal.,2
431,Because look at it this way.,2
432,Our society is changing.,2
433,Technology is fundamentally infiltrating,2
434,"every aspect of our daily lives,",2
435,transforming everything from how,2
436,we work to how we fall in love.,2
437,Why should sports be any different?,2
438,"You know, I think of my own",2
439,"childhood, you know.",2
440,I grew up watching,2
441,"the World Cup with my family,",2
442,and I learned to love soccer in large part,2
443,because I watched it with my dad.,2
444,And I would have loved doing,2
445,anything with him.,2
446,And now I think of my own sons.,2
447,"But instead of soccer,",2
448,"we're watching esports,",2
449,"not the violent ones, mind you.",2
450,But I'm building the same sorts,2
451,of memories with my kids,2
452,that my father did with me.,2
453,We're marveling at the same skill,2
454,and reveling in the same victory.,2
455,It is an identical feeling,2
456,of pure awe and excitement.,2
457,It's just a different game.,2
458,Thank you very much.,2
459,"In 1998, my friends and I",3
460,won a national art competition.,3
461,"The prize was a week in Disneyland Paris,",3
462,with hundreds of other children,3
463,"from across the world,",3
464,as delegates to UNESCO's,3
465,International Children's Summit.,3
466,Now this was no ordinary,3
467,trip to Disneyland.,3
468,Between running riot in the park,3
469,"and making friends,",3
470,we workshopped the future of this planet.,3
471,How could we overcome,3
472,the problems of pollution,3
473,and their threats to human,3
474,and environmental health?,3
475,How could we guarantee,3
476,universal human rights,3
477,"of equality, justice and dignity?",3
478,"Towards the end of the summit,",3
479,"we created a 20-year time capsule,",3
480,with each country planting a vision,3
481,of the future they hoped for.,3
482,"But as I look around today,",3
483,it's clear to me that those visions,3
484,have not come true yet.,3
485,"We're confronted by the same crises,",3
486,made infinitely worse through decades,3
487,of geopolitical inaction.,3
488,We now face global existential risks,3
489,"as a result of the climate emergency,",3
490,with the world's least-resourced,3
491,and most disenfranchised,3
492,made more vulnerable despite,3
493,having contributed least to the problem.,3
494,That trip to Disneyland,3
495,taught me that art and design,3
496,had the power to imagine,3
497,other possible futures.,3
498,The question is:,3
499,"""""How do we actually build them?""""",3
500,"Today, I lead a design agency",3
501,"called Faber Futures,",3
502,and my team and I design,3
503,"at the intersection of biology,",3
504,technology and society.,3
506,"and development collaborations,",3
507,"partnerships, and other strategies,",3
508,we model a future in which both people,3
509,and planet can thrive,3
510,and where the role that biotechnology,3
511,plays is shaped through plural visions.,3
512,Our design work prototypes the future.,3
513,"We have developed toxin-free,",3
514,water-efficient textile dye processes,3
515,"with a pigment-producing bacterium,",3
516,pioneering new ways,3
517,of thinking about circular design,3
518,for the textile and fashion industries.,3
519,You've probably already heard,3
520,"of data surveillance,",3
521,but what if it was biological?,3
522,Using open-source data,3
523,"on the human microbiome,",3
524,we’ve created experiential artworks,3
525,that engage with the ethics of DNA mining.,3
526,How can we embed a culture,3
527,of multidisciplinary codesign,3
528,from within the industry of biotechnology?,3
529,"To find out, we designed",3
530,"the Ginkgo Creative Residency,",3
531,which invites creative practitioners,3
532,to spend several months,3
533,developing their own projects,3
534,from within the Ginkgo Bioworks foundry.,3
535,We also generate and publish,3
536,unique and expansive dialogues,3
537,between people with different,3
538,types of knowledges —,3
539,"Afrofuturists with astrobiologists,",3
541,with Indigenous campaigners.,3
542,The stories that they and others tell,3
543,give us the tools we need to imagine,3
544,other biological futures.,3
545,"Design deeply permeates all of our lives,",3
546,and yet we tend to recognize things,3
547,and not the complex systems,3
548,that actually produce them.,3

571,the kinds of systems that might drive,3
572,the design of your smartphone,3
573,or even a rideshare service.,3
574,But when it comes,3
575,"to the design of biology,",3
576,things become a little bit more abstract.,3
577,Organism engineers design microbes,3
578,"to do industrially useful things,",3
579,like bioremediate toxic waste sites,3
580,or replace petroleum-based textiles,3

582,To architect this level of biological,3
583,"precision and performance at scale,",3
584,"tools like DNA sequencing, automation",3

636,that unwittingly reinforce,3
637,social and ecological inequities.,3
638,Addressing these asymmetries,3
639,requires us to take,3
640,"a more revolutionary approach,",3
641,one that begins by asking,3
642,"""""What kind of a world do we wish for?""""",3
643,So what if we could do both?,3

735,the computer scientists who designed them,4
736,likely don’t know exactly,4
737,how they’re doing it.,4
738,This is because artificial intelligence,4
739,"is often self-taught,",4
740,working off a simple set of instructions,4
741,to create a unique array,4
742,of rules and strategies.,4
743,So how exactly does a machine learn?,4
744,There are many different ways,4
745,to build self-teaching programs.,4
746,But they all rely on the three,4
747,basic types of machine learning:,4
748,"unsupervised learning, supervised",4
749,"learning, and reinforcement learning.",4
750,"To see these in action,",4
751,let’s imagine researchers are trying,4
752,to pull information,4
753,from a set of medical data containing,4
754,thousands of patient profiles.,4
755,"First up, unsupervised learning.",4
756,This approach would be ideal,4
757,for analyzing all the profiles,4
758,to find general similarities,4
759,and useful patterns.,4
760,Maybe certain patients have similar,4
762,or perhaps a treatment produces,4
763,specific sets of side effects.,4
764,This broad pattern-seeking approach,4
765,can be used to identify similarities,4
766,between patient profiles,4
767,"and find emerging patterns,",4
768,all without human guidance.,4
769,But let's imagine doctors are looking,4
770,for something more specific.,4
771,These physicians want,4
772,to create an algorithm,4
773,for diagnosing a particular condition.,4
774,They begin by collecting two sets of data—,4
775,medical images and test results,4
776,from both healthy patients,4
777,and those diagnosed with the condition.,4
778,"Then, they input this data into a program",4
779,designed to identify features,4
780,shared by the sick patients,4
781,but not the healthy patients.,4
782,Based on how frequently,4
783,"it sees certain features,",4
784,the program will assign values to those,4
785,"features’ diagnostic significance,",4
786,generating an algorithm,4
787,for diagnosing future patients.,4
788,"However, unlike unsupervised learning,",4
789,doctors and computer scientists have,4
790,an active role in what happens next.,4
791,Doctors will make the final diagnosis,4
792,and check the accuracy,4
793,of the algorithm’s prediction.,4
794,Then computer scientists can use,4
795,the updated datasets,4
796,to adjust the program’s parameters,4
797,and improve its accuracy.,4
798,This hands-on approach is called,4
800,"Now, let’s say these doctors want",4
801,to design another algorithm,4
802,to recommend treatment plans.,4
803,Since these plans,4
804,"will be implemented in stages,",4
805,and they may change depending on each,4
806,"individual's response to treatments,",4
807,the doctors decide to use,4
809,This program uses an iterative approach,4
810,to gather feedback,4
811,"about which medications, dosages",4
812,and treatments are most effective.,4
813,"Then, it compares that data",4
814,against each patient’s profile,4
815,"to create their unique, optimal",4
817,As the treatments progress and the program,4
818,"receives more feedback,",4
819,it can constantly update,4
820,the plan for each patient.,4
821,None of these three techniques are,4
822,inherently smarter than any other.,4
823,While some require more or less,4
825,they all have their own strengths,4
827,which makes them best suited,4
828,for certain tasks.,4
829,"However, by using them together,",4
830,"researchers can build complex AI systems,",4
831,where individual programs can,4
832,supervise and teach each other.,4
834,when our unsupervised learning program,4
835,"finds groups of patients that are similar,",4
836,it could send that data to a connected,4
837,supervised learning program.,4
838,That program could then incorporate,4
839,this information into its predictions.,4
840,Or perhaps dozens of reinforcement,4
842,might simulate potential patient outcomes,4
843,to collect feedback,4
844,about different treatment plans.,4
845,There are numerous ways to create,4
846,"these machine-learning systems,",4
847,and perhaps the most promising models,4
848,are those that mimic the relationship,4
849,between neurons in the brain.,4
850,These artificial neural networks can use,4
851,millions of connections,4
852,to tackle difficult tasks like,4
853,"image recognition, speech recognition,",4
854,and even language translation.,4
855,"However, the more self-directed",4
856,"these models become,",4
857,the harder it is for computer scientists,4
858,to determine how these self-taught,4
859,algorithms arrive at their solution.,4
860,Researchers are already looking at ways,4
861,to make machine learning more transparent.,4
862,But as AI becomes more involved,4
863,"in our everyday lives,",4
864,these enigmatic decisions have,4
865,increasingly large impacts,4
866,"on our work, health, and safety.",4
867,So as machines continue learning,4
868,"to investigate, negotiate and communicate,",4
869,we must also consider how to teach them,4
870,to teach each other to operate ethically.,4
871,"In this research lab,",5
872,I discovered a story,5
873,that is swiftly changing our world.,5

888,"Imagine technologies like robotics,",5
893,and many others —,5
894,when combined with each other,5
895,and blended with engineering,5
896,"and design science,",5

899,So what is deep tech?,5
900,I've spent the last 18 months,5
901,visiting 100 research labs,5
903,"from Shenzhen in China to Haifa in Israel,",5
904,and this is what I learned,5
905,about deep tech ventures.,5
906,"They focus on fundamental issues,",5
907,identifying physical constraints,5
908,of industries not solved for decades.,5

917,"and many others,",5
918,they focus on physical product,5
919,using data and digital platform,5
920,to accelerate the test-and-run phase.,5
921,They rely on an ecosystem,5
922,"to accelerate the innovation cycle,",5
923,including the build-and-test phase.,5
924,Too many disciplines are necessary,5
925,to master for one venture to go alone.,5
926,"It is about cooperation,",5
928,Deep tech is ultimately,5
930,into a design and engineering exercise.,5
932,why does it matter?,5
933,"It matters because it is happening now,",5
934,"all around us,",5
936,This approach is changing,5
937,what was once considered impossible,5
938,into something actively possible today.,5

942,by producing reusable,5
943,"rockets and spaceships,",5
944,reducing the cost of going to space,5
945,by a factor of 10.,5
946,They achieved this by combining,5
948,and chemicals developed,5
949,in the last 20 years,5
950,with vertical integration,5
951,and the modular approach,5
952,of modern software engineering.,5

959,to create an analog quantum processor.,5
960,Or take Boston-based Ginkgo Bioworks,5
961,founded by internet pioneer Tom Knight,5
962,and a group of MIT scientists.,5
963,A visit to Ginkgo showed me a lab,5

965,I saw a fully automated bioworks lab,5
966,"with the latest robotic techniques,",5
967,allowing to test thousands,5
968,of biological designs.,5
969,They achieved this by building,5
970,the largest internal metagenomics database,5
971,"of cells, enzymes and genetic programming",5
972,"by combining robotics,",5
974,both in microorganism,5
975,and mammalian cells,5

978,a cell programming platform,5
979,able to create nearly,5
980,any organism they want,5
981,"by converging science,",5

992,Will investors be ready,5
993,to play the deep tech game?,5
994,"Yes, there is a technological risk.",5
995,And developing deep tech requires,5
996,to rethink our innovation approach.,5
997,I have seen that four rules,5
998,govern successful deep tech ventures.,5
999,Rule number one:,5
1000,"be problem oriented,",5
1001,not technology focused.,5
1002,This is very important.,5
1003,Many deep tech ventures start,5
1004,with a solution in search of a problem.,5
1005,Ginkgo partnered with Bayer,5
1006,to solve the nitrogen fertilizer issue.,5
1007,Nitrogen is the most-used fertilizer,5
1008,in the world today.,5
1009,But it produces three percent,5
1010,of greenhouse gases,5
1011,and it pollutes water.,5
1012,Many start-ups today,5
1013,are trying to solve this issue,5
1014,by applying their solutions.,5
1015,Ginkgo tried to solve it,5
1016,by asking the question in another way:,5
1017,"what if instead of producing nitrogen,",5
1018,we create a bacteria,5
1019,that use existing nitrogen,5
1020,"to fixate it on the roots of the plants,",5
1021,just like nature does?,5
1022,Rule number two:,5
1023,"it is about combining,",5
1025,So you need to bring,5
1026,a cross-disciplinary team early on,5
1027,and play the ecosystem.,5
1028,What does that mean concretely?,5
1029,"Take Commonwealth Fusion Systems,",5
1030,an energy venture focusing,5
1031,on nuclear fusion.,5
1032,They achieved their breakthrough,5
1033,in nuclear fusion,5
1034,by combining advances,5
1035,in material and data science,5
1036,that enabled them to do,5
1037,calculation and simulation,5
1038,that was simply not doable,5
1039,a few years back.,5
1040,And they play the ecosystem very well.,5
1041,Corporates like ENI and Equinor,5
1042,have invested early on.,5
1043,Universities like the MIT,5
1044,Plasma Science and Fusion Centers,5
1045,are actively collaborating with them.,5
1046,VCs like Breakthrough,5
1047,"Energy Ventures and others,",5
1048,"are supporting them,",5
1049,and the US government,5
1050,seems interested in working with them.,5
1051,Rule number three:,5
1052,adopt a design thinking approach,5
1053,powered by deep tech.,5
1054,Identify assumptions early on to be tested,5
1055,to reduce the risk up front.,5
1056,Get to a working prototype,5
1057,as quickly as possible.,5
1058,Anticipate friction points,5
1059,at each stage of the innovation cycle.,5
1060,Use a data and digital platform,5
1061,to reduce the cost of testing them.,5
1063,a deep tech start-up,5
1064,"building all-electric air taxi,",5
1065,"aiming at solving urban air mobility,",5
1066,has started by developing,5
1067,"a two-seater prototype,",5
1068,then a five-seater using,5
1069,real-time data of every flight,5
1070,to design the next version.,5
1071,Rule number four:,5
1072,adopt a design-to-cost approach.,5
1073,Merging science with engineering,5
1074,requires to have the economics in mind,5
1075,all the time.,5
1077,"another synthetic biology lighthouse,",5
1078,"whenever they design a product,",5
1079,use a ruthless design-to-cost approach.,5
1080,"In the design phase,",5
1081,"even before production starts,",5
1082,they look for the right products,5
1083,at the right costs,5
1084,with the right parameters.,5
1085,Zymergen developed Hyaline,5
1086,"a transparent, printable",5
1087,"circuit for electronics,",5
1088,produced by fermentation.,5
1089,And this biobased film is cheaper,5
1090,and has better properties,5
1091,"than the existing one,",5
1093,Deep tech is maturing quickly now.,5
1094,"In 2019, there were more",5
1095,"than 5,000 deep tech ventures",5
1096,fueled by 50 billion dollars,5
1097,of investors and their money.,5
1098,Ventures coming out of research labs,5
1099,have the power to solve,5
1100,our most pressing issues.,5
1101,Think what you would like,5
1102,to grow in your world.,5
1103,Consider how might deep tech,5
1104,"help you cultivate that thing,",5
1105,maybe by accelerating a drug development,5
1106,or by eliminating greenhouse gases,5
1107,or perhaps by solving the congestion,5
1108,problem plaguing your city.,5
1109,Deep tech is an ever-growing,5
1110,"opportunity in front of us,",5
1111,waiting to be scaled,5
1112,for this world and more.,5
1113,It is the next chapter,5
1114,"in the innovation story,",5
1115,and today I invite all of you,5
1116,to join me in its creation.,5
1118,AI could add 16 trillion dollars,6
1119,to the global economy,6
1120,in the next 10 years.,6
1121,This economy is not going,6
1122,to be built by billions of people,6
1123,"or millions of factories,",6
1124,but by computers and algorithms.,6
1125,We have already seen,6
1126,amazing benefits of AI,6
1127,"in simplifying tasks,",6
1129,and improving our lives.,6
1130,"However, when it comes to fair",6
1131,"and equitable policy decision-making,",6
1132,AI has not lived up to its promise.,6
1133,AI is becoming a gatekeeper,6
1134,"to the economy,",6
1135,deciding who gets a job,6
1136,and who gets an access to a loan.,6
1137,AI is only reinforcing,6
1138,and accelerating our bias,6
1139,at speed and scale,6
1140,with societal implications.,6
1141,"So, is AI failing us?",6
1142,Are we designing these algorithms,6
1143,to deliver biased and wrong decisions?,6
1144,"As a data scientist, I'm here to tell you,",6
1145,"it's not the algorithm,",6
1146,but the biased data,6
1147,that's responsible for these decisions.,6
1148,To make AI possible,6
1149,"for humanity and society,",6
1150,we need an urgent reset.,6
1151,"Instead of algorithms,",6
1152,we need to focus on the data.,6
1153,We're spending time and money to scale AI,6
1154,at the expense of designing and collecting,6
1155,high-quality and contextual data.,6
1156,"We need to stop the data,",6
1157,"or the biased data that we already have,",6
1158,and focus on three things:,6
1161,and data literacy.,6
1162,"In June of this year,",6
1163,we saw embarrassing bias,6
1164,in the Duke University AI model,6
1166,which enhanced a blurry image,6
1167,into a recognizable,6
1168,photograph of a person.,6
1169,This algorithm incorrectly enhanced,6
1170,a nonwhite image into a Caucasian image.,6
1172,"were underrepresented in the training set,",6
1173,leading to wrong decisions,6
1175,Probably this is not the first time,6
1176,you have seen an AI misidentify,6
1177,a Black person's image.,6
1178,"Despite an improved AI methodology,",6
1180,of racial and ethnic populations,6
1181,still left us with biased results.,6
1182,"This research is academic,",6
1183,"however, not all data biases are academic.",6
1184,Biases have real consequences.,6
1185,Take the 2020 US Census.,6
1186,The census is the foundation,6
1187,for many social,6
1188,"and economic policy decisions,",6
1189,therefore the census is required,6
1190,to count 100 percent of the population,6
1191,in the United States.,6
1192,"However, with the pandemic",6
1193,and the politics,6
1194,"of the citizenship question,",6
1195,undercounting of minorities,6
1196,is a real possibility.,6
1197,I expect significant undercounting,6
1198,of minority groups,6
1199,"who are hard to locate, contact, persuade",6
1200,and interview for the census.,6
1201,Undercounting will introduce bias,6
1202,and erode the quality,6
1203,of our data infrastructure.,6
1204,Let's look at undercounts,6
1205,in the 2010 census.,6
1206,16 million people were omitted,6
1207,in the final counts.,6
1208,This is as large as the total population,6
1209,"of Arizona, Arkansas, Oklahoma",6
1210,and Iowa put together for that year.,6
1211,We have also seen about a million kids,6
1212,under the age of five undercounted,6
1213,in the 2010 Census.,6
1214,"Now, undercounting of minorities",6
1215,"is common in other national censuses,",6
1216,"as minorities can be harder to reach,",6
1217,they're mistrustful towards the government,6
1218,or they live in an area,6
1219,under political unrest.,6
1221,the Australian Census in 2016,6
1223,and Torres Strait populations,6
1224,by about 17.5 percent.,6
1225,We estimate undercounting in 2020,6
1226,"to be much higher than 2010,",6
1227,and the implications,6
1228,of this bias can be massive.,6
1229,Let's look at the implications,6
1230,of the census data.,6
1231,"Census is the most trusted, open",6
1232,and publicly available rich data,6
1233,on population composition,6
1236,have proprietary information,6
1238,the Census Bureau,6
1239,"reports definitive, public counts",6
1240,"on age, gender, ethnicity,",6
1241,"race, employment, family status,",6
1242,"as well as geographic distribution,",6
1243,which are the foundation,6
1244,of the population data infrastructure.,6
1245,"When minorities are undercounted,",6
1246,AI models supporting,6
1248,"housing, health care,",6
1250,are likely to overlook the communities,6
1251,that require these services the most.,6
1252,First step to improving results,6
1253,is to make that database representative,6
1254,"of age, gender, ethnicity and race",6
1255,per census data.,6
1256,"Since census is so important,",6
1257,we have to make every effort,6
1258,to count 100 percent.,6
1259,Investing in this data,6
1260,quality and accuracy,6
1261,"is essential to making AI possible,",6
1262,"not for only few and privileged,",6
1263,but for everyone in the society.,6
1264,Most AI systems use the data,6
1265,that's already available,6
1266,or collected for some other purposes,6
1267,because it's convenient and cheap.,6
1268,Yet data quality is a discipline,6
1269,that requires commitment —,6
1271,"This attention to the definition,",6
1273,"and measurement of the bias,",6
1274,is not only underappreciated —,6
1275,"in the world of speed,",6
1276,"scale and convenience,",6
1277,it's often ignored.,6
1278,"As part of Nielsen data science team,",6
1279,"I went to field visits to collect data,",6
1280,visiting retail stores,6
1281,outside Shanghai and Bangalore.,6
1282,The goal of that visit was to measure,6
1283,retail sales from those stores.,6
1284,"We drove miles outside the city,",6
1285,found these small stores —,6
1286,"informal, hard to reach.",6
1287,And you may be wondering —,6
1288,why are we interested,6
1289,in these specific stores?,6
1290,We could have selected a store in the city,6
1291,where the electronic data could be,6
1292,easily integrated into a data pipeline —,6
1293,"cheap, convenient and easy.",6
1294,Why are we so obsessed with the quality,6
1295,and accuracy of the data,6
1296,from these stores?,6
1297,The answer is simple:,6
1298,because the data,6
1299,from these rural stores matter.,6
1300,According to the International,6
1302,40 percent Chinese,6
1303,and 65 percent of Indians,6
1304,live in rural areas.,6
1305,Imagine the bias in decision,6
1306,when 65 percent of consumption,6
1307,"in India is excluded in models,",6
1308,meaning the decision will favor,6
1309,the urban over the rural.,6
1310,Without this rural-urban context,6
1311,"and signals on livelihood,",6
1312,"lifestyle, economy and values,",6
1313,retail brands will make wrong investments,6
1314,"on pricing, advertising and marketing.",6
1315,Or the urban bias will lead,6
1316,to wrong rural policy decisions,6
1317,with regards to health,6
1318,and other investments.,6
1319,Wrong decisions are not the problem,6
1320,with the AI algorithm.,6
1321,It's a problem of the data,6
1322,that excludes areas intended,6
1323,to be measured in the first place.,6
1324,"The data in the context is a priority,",6
1325,not the algorithms.,6
1326,Let's look at another example.,6
1327,"I visited these remote,",6
1328,trailer park homes in Oregon state,6
1329,and New York City apartments,6
1330,to invite these homes,6
1331,to participate in Nielsen panels.,6
1332,Panels are statistically,6
1333,representative samples of homes,6
1334,that we invite to participate,6
1335,in the measurement,6
1336,over a period of time.,6
1337,Our mission to include everybody,6
1338,in the measurement,6
1339,led us to collect data,6
1340,from these Hispanic and African homes,6
1341,who use over-the-air,6
1342,TV reception to an antenna.,6
1343,"Per Nielsen data,",6
1344,these homes constitute,6
1345,"15 percent of US households,",6
1346,which is about 45 million people.,6
1347,Commitment and focus on quality,6
1348,means we made every effort,6
1349,to collect information,6
1350,"from these 15 percent,",6
1352,Why does it matter?,6
1353,This is a sizeable group,6
1354,"that's very, very important",6
1355,"to the marketers, brands,",6
1356,as well as the media companies.,6
1357,"Without the data,",6
1358,the marketers and brands and their models,6
1359,"would not be able to reach these folks,",6
1360,as well as show ads to these,6
1361,"very, very important minority populations.",6
1362,"And without the ad revenue,",6
1363,the broadcasters such as,6
1364,"Telemundo or Univision,",6
1365,"would not be able to deliver free content,",6
1366,"including news media,",6
1367,which is so foundational to our democracy.,6
1368,This data is essential,6
1369,for businesses and society.,6
1370,Our once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,6
1371,to reduce human bias in AI,6
1372,starts with the data.,6
1373,"Instead of racing to build new algorithms,",6
1374,my mission is to build,6
1375,a better data infrastructure,6
1376,that makes ethical AI possible.,6
1377,I hope you will join me,6
1378,in my mission as well.,6
1380,Let me tell you a story,7
1381,about artificial intelligence.,7
1382,There's a building in Sydney,7
1383,at 1 Bligh Street.,7
1384,It houses lots of government apartments,7
1385,and busy people.,7
1386,"From the outside, it looks like something",7
1387,out of American science fiction:,7
1388,"all gleaming glass and curved lines,",7
1389,and a piece of orange sculpture.,7
1390,"On the inside, it has excellent coffee",7
1391,on the ground floor,7
1392,and my favorite lifts in Sydney.,7
1394,they look almost alive.,7
1395,And it turns out,7
1396,I'm fascinated with lifts.,7
1397,For lots of reasons.,7
1398,But because lifts are one of the places,7
1399,you can see the future.,7
1400,"In the 21st century, lifts are interesting",7
1401,because they're one of the first places,7
1402,that AI will touch you,7
1403,without you even knowing it happened.,7
1404,"In many buildings all around the world,",7
1405,the lifts are running a set of algorithms.,7
1406,A form of protoartificial intelligence.,7
1407,That means before you even,7
1408,"walk up to the lift to press the button,",7
1409,it's anticipated you being there.,7
1410,It's already rearranging,7
1411,all the carriages.,7
1412,"Always going down, to save energy,",7
1413,and to know where,7
1414,the traffic is going to be.,7
1415,By the time you've actually,7
1416,"pressed the button,",7
1417,you're already part of an entire system,7
1418,that's making sense of people,7
1419,and the environment,7
1420,and the building and the built world.,7
1421,"I know when we talk about AI,",7
1422,we often talk about a world of robots.,7
1423,It's easy for our imaginations,7
1424,"to be occupied with science fiction,",7
1425,"well, over the last 100 years.",7
1426,"I say AI and you think """"The Terminator.""""",7
1427,"Somewhere, for us, making the connection",7
1428,"between AI and the built world,",7
1429,that's a harder story to tell.,7
1430,But the reality is AI is already,7
1431,everywhere around us.,7
1432,And in many places.,7
1433,It's in buildings and in systems.,7
1434,More than 200 years of industrialization,7
1435,suggest that AI will find its way,7
1436,to systems-level scale relatively easily.,7
1437,"After all, one telling of that history",7
1438,suggests that all you have to do,7
1439,"is find a technology,",7
1440,achieve scale and revolution will follow.,7
1441,"The story of mechanization,",7
1442,automation and digitization,7
1443,all point to the role of technology,7
1444,and its importance.,7
1445,Those stories of technological,7
1447,"make scale seem, well, normal.",7
1450,And sometimes even predictable.,7
1451,But it also puts the focus squarely,7
1452,on technology and technology change.,7
1453,But I believe that scaling a technology,7
1454,and building a system,7
1455,requires something more.,7
1456,We founded the 3Ai Institute,7
1457,at the Australian National University,7
1458,in September 2017.,7
1459,It has one deceptively simple mission:,7
1460,to establish a new branch of engineering,7
1461,"to take AI safely, sustainably",7
1462,and responsibly to scale.,7
1463,But how do you build a new branch,7
1464,of engineering in the 21st century?,7
1465,"Well, we're teaching it into existence",7
1466,through an experimental education program.,7
1467,We're researching it into existence,7
1468,with locations as diverse,7
1469,"as Shakespeare's birthplace,",7
1470,"the Great Barrier Reef,",7
1471,not to mention one of Australia's,7
1472,largest autonomous mines.,7
1473,"And we're theorizing it into existence,",7
1474,paying attention to the complexities,7
1475,of cybernetic systems.,7
1476,We're working to build something new,7
1477,and something useful.,7
1478,Something to create the next generation,7
1479,of critical thinkers and critical doers.,7
1480,And we're doing all of that,7
1481,through a richer understanding,7
1482,of AI's many pasts and many stories.,7
1483,And by working collaboratively,7
1485,through teaching and research,7
1487,and by focusing as much,7
1488,on the framing of the questions,7
1489,as the solving of the problems.,7
1490,"We're not making a single AI,",7
1491,we're making the possibilities for many.,7
1492,And we're actively working,7
1493,to decolonize our imaginations,7
1494,and to build a curriculum and a pedagogy,7
1495,that leaves room for a range of different,7
1496,conversations and possibilities.,7
1497,We are making and remaking.,7
1498,And I know we're always,7
1499,a work in progress.,7
1500,But here's a little glimpse,7
1501,into how we're approaching,7
1502,that problem of scaling a future.,7
1503,We start by making sure,7
1504,we're grounded in our own history.,7
1505,"In December of 2018,",7
1506,I took myself up to the town of Brewarrina,7
1507,on the New South Wales-Queensland border.,7
1508,This place was a meeting place,7
1509,"for Aboriginal people,",7
1510,"for different groups,",7
1511,"to gather, have ceremonies,",7
1512,"meet, to be together.",7
1513,"There, on the Barwon River,",7
1514,there's a set of fish weirs,7
1515,that are one of the oldest,7
1516,and largest systems,7
1517,of Aboriginal fish traps in Australia.,7
1518,This system is comprised,7
1519,of 1.8 kilometers of stone walls,7
1520,shaped like a series of fishnets,7
1521,"with the """"Us"""" pointing down the river,",7
1522,allowing fish to be trapped,7
1523,at different heights of the water.,7
1524,They're also fish holding pens,7
1525,"with different-height walls for storage,",7
1526,designed to change the way the water moves,7
1527,and to be able to store,7
1528,big fish and little fish,7
1529,and to keep those fish,7
1530,"in cool, clear running water.",7
1531,This fish-trap system was a way to ensure,7
1532,that you could feed people,7
1533,as they gathered there in a place,7
1534,that was both a meeting of rivers,7
1535,and a meeting of cultures.,7
1536,It isn't about the rocks,7
1537,or even the traps per se.,7
1538,It is about the system,7
1539,that those traps created.,7
1540,"One that involves technical knowledge,",7
1542,and ecological knowledge.,7
1543,This system is old.,7
1545,"think it's as old as 40,000 years.",7
1546,The last time we have its recorded uses,7
1547,is in the nineteen teens.,7
1548,It's had remarkable longevity,7
1549,and incredible scale.,7
1550,And it's an inspiration to me.,7
1551,And a photo of the weir,7
1552,"is on our walls here at the Institute,",7
1553,to remind us of the promise,7
1554,and the challenge,7
1555,of building something meaningful.,7
1556,And to remind us,7
1557,that we're building systems,7
1558,in a place where people have built systems,7
1559,and sustained those same systems,7
1561,"It isn't just our history,",7
1562,it's our legacy as we seek to establish,7
1563,a new branch of engineering.,7
1564,To build on that legacy,7
1565,"and our sense of purpose,",7
1566,I think we need a clear framework,7
1567,for asking questions about the future.,7
1568,Questions for which there aren't,7
1569,ready or easy answers.,7
1570,"Here, the point is the asking",7
1571,of the questions.,7
1572,We believe you need to go,7
1573,beyond the traditional approach,7
1575,to the more complicated one,7
1576,of question asking,7
1577,and question framing.,7
1578,"Because in so doing, you open up",7
1579,all kinds of new possibilities,7
1580,and new challenges.,7
1581,"For me, right now,",7
1582,there are six big questions,7
1583,that frame our approach,7
1584,"for taking AI safely, sustainably",7
1585,and responsibly to scale.,7
1586,"Questions about autonomy,",7
1588,"indicators, interfaces and intentionality.",7
1589,The first question we ask is a simple one.,7
1590,Is the system autonomous?,7
1591,Think back to that lift on Bligh Street.,7
1592,"The reality is, one day,",7
1593,that lift may be autonomous.,7
1594,Which is to say it will be able,7
1595,to act without being told to act.,7
1596,"But it isn't fully autonomous, right?",7
1597,It can't leave that Bligh Street building,7
1598,and wonder down,7
1599,to Circular Quay for a beer.,7
1600,"It goes up and down, that's all.",7
1601,But it does it by itself.,7
1602,It's autonomous in that sense.,7
1603,The second question we ask:,7
1604,does this system have agency?,7
1605,Does this system have controls,7
1606,and limits that live somewhere,7
1607,that prevent it from doing certain,7
1608,kinds of things under certain conditions.,7
1609,"The reality with lifts,",7
1610,that's absolutely the case.,7
1611,Think of any lift you've been in.,7
1612,There's a red keyslot,7
1613,in the elevator carriage,7
1614,that an emergency services person,7
1615,can stick a key into,7
1616,and override the whole system.,7
1617,But what happens,7
1618,when that system is AI-driven?,7
1619,Where does the key live?,7
1620,"Is it a physical key, is it a digital key?",7
1621,Who gets to use it?,7
1622,Is that the emergency services people?,7
1623,And how would you know,7
1624,if that was happening?,7
1625,How would all of that be manifested,7
1626,to you in the lift?,7
1627,The third question we ask,7
1628,is how do we think about assurance.,7
1629,How do we think about all of its pieces:,7
1630,"safety, security, trust, risk,",7
1633,"public policy, law, regulation?",7
1634,And how would we tell you,7
1635,that the system was safe and functioning?,7
1636,The fourth question we ask,7
1637,is what would be our interfaces,7
1638,with these AI-driven systems.,7
1639,Will we talk to them?,7
1640,"Will they talk to us,",7
1641,will they talk to each other?,7
1642,And what will it mean to have,7
1643,"a series of technologies we've known,",7
1644,"for some of us, all our lives,",7
1645,now suddenly behave,7
1646,in entirely different ways?,7
1647,"Lifts, cars, the electrical grid,",7
1648,"traffic lights, things in your home.",7
1649,The fifth question,7
1650,for these AI-driven systems:,7
1651,What will the indicators be,7
1652,to show that they're working well?,7
1653,Two hundred years,7
1654,of the industrial revolution,7
1655,tells us that the two most important ways,7
1656,to think about a good system,7
1657,are productivity and efficiency.,7
1658,"In the 21st century,",7
1659,you might want to expand,7
1660,that just a little bit.,7
1661,"Is the system sustainable,",7
1662,"is it safe, is it responsible?",7
1663,Who gets to judge those things for us?,7
1664,Users of the systems,7
1665,would want to understand,7
1666,"how these things are regulated,",7
1667,managed and built.,7
1668,"And then there's the final,",7
1669,perhaps most critical question,7
1670,that you need to ask,7
1671,of these new AI systems.,7
1672,What's its intent?,7
1673,What's the system designed to do,7
1674,and who said that was a good idea?,7
1675,"Or put another way,",7
1676,what is the world,7
1677,"that this system is building,",7
1678,"how is that world imagined,",7
1679,and what is its relationship,7
1680,to the world we live in today?,7
1681,Who gets to be part of that conversation?,7
1682,Who gets to articulate it?,7
1683,How does it get framed and imagined?,7
1684,There are no simple answers,7
1685,to these questions.,7
1686,"Instead, they frame what's possible",7
1687,"and what we need to imagine,",7
1688,"design, build, regulate",7
1689,and even decommission.,7
1690,They point us in the right directions,7
1691,and help us on a path to establish,7
1692,a new branch of engineering.,7
1693,But critical questions aren't enough.,7
1694,You also need a way of holding,7
1695,all those questions together.,7
1696,"For us at the Institute,",7
1697,we're also really interested,7
1698,"in how to think about AI as a system,",7
1699,and where and how to draw,7
1700,the boundaries of that system.,7
1701,And those feel like especially,7
1702,important things right now.,7
1703,"Here, we're influenced by the work",7
1704,that was started way back in the 1940s.,7
1705,"In 1944, along with anthropologists",7
1706,"Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead,",7
1707,mathematician Norbert Wiener,7
1708,convened a series of conversations,7
1709,that would become known,7
1710,as the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics.,7
1711,"Ultimately, between 1946 and 1953,",7
1712,ten conferences were held,7
1713,under the banner of cybernetics.,7
1714,"As defined by Norbert Wiener,",7
1716,"to """"develop a language and techniques",7
1717,that will enable us to indeed attack,7
1718,the problem of control and communication,7
1719,"in advanced computing technologies.""""",7
1720,Cybernetics argued persuasively,7
1721,that one had to think,7
1722,about the relationship,7
1723,"between humans, computers",7
1724,and the broader ecological world.,7
1725,You had to think about them,7
1726,as a holistic system.,7
1727,Participants in the Macy Conferences,7
1728,"were concerned with how the mind worked,",7
1729,with ideas about,7
1730,"intelligence and learning,",7
1731,and about the role,7
1732,of technology in our future.,7
1733,"Sadly, the conversations that started",7
1734,with the Macy Conference,7
1735,are often forgotten,7
1736,when the talk is about AI.,7
1737,"But for me, there's something",7
1738,really important to reclaim here,7
1739,about the idea of a system,7
1740,"that has to accommodate culture,",7
1741,technology and the environment.,7
1742,"At the Institute, that sort",7
1743,of systems thinking is core to our work.,7
1744,"Over the last three years,",7
1745,a whole collection of amazing people,7
1746,have joined me here,7
1747,on this crazy journey to do this work.,7
1748,"Our staff includes anthropologists,",7
1749,"systems and environmental engineers,",7
1750,and computer scientists,7
1751,"as well as a nuclear physicist,",7
1752,"an award-winning photo journalist,",7
1753,and at least one policy,7
1754,and standards expert.,7
1755,It's a heady mix.,7
1756,And the range of experience,7
1757,"and expertise is powerful,",7
1758,as are the conflicts and the challenges.,7
1759,Being diverse requires,7
1760,a constant willingness,7
1761,to find ways to hold people,7
1763,And to dwell just a little bit,7
1764,with the conflict.,7
1765,We also worked out early,7
1766,that the way to build,7
1767,a new way of doing things,7
1768,would require a commitment to bringing,7
1769,others along on that same journey with us.,7
1770,So we opened our doors,7
1771,"to an education program very quickly,",7
1772,and we launched our first,7
1773,master's program in 2018.,7
1774,"Since then, we've had two cohorts",7
1775,of master's students,7
1776,and one cohort of PhD students.,7
1777,Our students come from all over the world,7
1778,and all over life.,7
1779,"Australia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Nepal,",7
1780,"Mexico, India, the United States.",7
1781,And they range in age from 23 to 60.,7
1782,They variously had backgrounds,7
1783,"in maths and music,",7
1784,"policy and performance,",7
1785,"systems and standards,",7
1786,architecture and arts.,7
1787,"Before they joined us at the Institute,",7
1788,"they ran companies,",7
1789,"they worked for government,",7
1790,"served in the army, taught high school,",7
1791,and managed arts organizations.,7
1792,They were adventurers,7
1793,"and committed to each other,",7
1794,and to building something new.,7
1795,"And really, what more could you ask for?",7
1796,Because although I've spent,7
1797,20 years in Silicon Valley,7
1798,and I know the stories,7
1799,about the lone inventor,7
1800,"and the hero's journey,",7
1801,I also know the reality.,7
1802,That it's never just a hero's journey.,7
1803,It's always a collection of people,7
1804,who have a shared sense of purpose,7
1805,who can change the world.,7
1806,So where do you start?,7
1807,"Well, I think you start where you stand.",7
1808,"And for me, that means",7
1809,I want to acknowledge,7
1810,the traditional owners of the land,7
1811,upon which I'm standing.,7
1812,"The Ngunnawal and Ngambri people,",7
1813,"this is their land,",7
1814,"never ceded, always sacred.",7
1815,"And I pay my respects to the elders,",7
1816,"past and present, of this place.",7
1817,I also acknowledge,7
1818,that we're gathering today,7
1819,"in many other places,",7
1820,and I pay my respects,7
1821,to the traditional owners and elders,7
1822,of all those places too.,7
1823,It means a lot to me,7
1824,to get to say those words,7
1825,and to dwell on what they mean and signal.,7
1826,And to remember that we live in a country,7
1827,that has been continuously occupied,7
1828,"for at least 60,000 years.",7
1829,"Aboriginal people built worlds here,",7
1830,"they built social systems,",7
1831,they built technologies.,7
1832,They built ways to manage this place,7
1833,and to manage it remarkably,7
1834,over a protracted period of time.,7
1835,And every moment any one of us,7
1836,"stands on a stage as Australians,",7
1837,"here or abroad,",7
1838,we carry with us a privilege,7
1839,and a responsibility,7
1840,because of that history.,7
1841,And it's not just a history.,7
1842,It's also an incredibly rich,7
1843,"set of resources,",7
1844,worldviews and knowledge.,7
1845,And it should run through all of our bones,7
1846,and it should be the story we always tell.,7
1847,"Ultimately, it's about",7
1849,"asking different kinds of questions,",7
1851,"at the world and the systems,",7
1852,and finding other people who want,7
1853,to be on that journey with you.,7
1854,"Because for me,",7
1855,the only way to actually think,7
1856,about the future and scale,7
1857,is to always be doing it collectively.,7
1858,"And because for me,",7
1859,the notion of humans in it together,7
1860,is one of the ways,7
1861,we get to think about things,7
1862,"that are responsible, safe",7
1863,"and ultimately, sustainable.",7
1865,"In 1987, a Chilean engineer",8
1866,named Oscar Duhalde,8
1867,became the only,8
1868,living person on the planet,8
1869,to discover a rare astronomical event,8
1870,with the naked eye.,8
1871,Oscar was a telescope operator,8
1872,at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.,8
1873,He worked with the astronomers who came,8
1874,"to the observatory for their research,",8
1875,running the telescopes and processing,8
1876,the data that they took.,8
1877,"On the night of February 24th,",8
1878,Oscar stepped outside for a break,8
1879,and looked up at the night sky,8
1880,and he saw this.,8
1881,This is the Large Magellanic Cloud.,8
1882,It's a satellite galaxy very near,8
1883,our own Milky Way.,8
1884,"But on that February night,",8
1885,Oscar noticed that something,8
1886,was different about this galaxy.,8
1887,It didn't quite look like this.,8
1888,It looked like this.,8
1889,Did you see it?,8
1891,A small point of light had appeared,8
1892,in one corner of this galaxy.,8
1893,So to explain how amazing it is,8
1894,"that Oscar noticed this,",8
1895,we need to zoom out a bit,8
1896,and look at what the southern,8
1897,sky in Chile looks like.,8
1898,The Large Magellanic Cloud,8
1899,"is right in the middle of that image,",8
1900,"but despite its name, it's really small.",8
1901,Imagine trying to notice,8
1902,one single new point of light,8
1903,appearing in that galaxy.,8
1904,Oscar was able to do this,8
1905,because he had the Large Magellanic Cloud,8
1907,He had worked on data,8
1908,"from this galaxy for years,",8
1909,poring over night after night,8
1911,"and doing it by hand,",8
1912,because Oscar had begun,8
1913,his work in astronomy,8
1914,at a time when we stored all of the data,8
1915,that we observed from the universe,8
1916,on fragile sheets of glass.,8
1917,"I know that today's theme is """"Moonshot,""""",8
1918,"and as an astronomer, I figured",8
1919,"I could start us out nice and literally,",8
1920,so here's a shot of the Moon.,8
1922,"It's a familiar sight to all of us,",8
1923,but there's a couple of unusual things,8
1924,about this particular image.,8
1925,"For one, I flipped the colors.",8
1926,It originally looked like this.,8
1927,"And if we zoom out, we can see",8
1928,how this picture was taken.,8
1929,This is a photograph,8
1930,of the Moon taken in 1894,8
1931,on a glass photographic plate.,8
1932,This was the technology that astronomers,8
1933,had available for decades,8
1934,to store the observations,8
1935,that we took of the night sky.,8
1936,I've actually brought an example,8
1937,of a glass plate to show you.,8
1938,So this looks like a real secure way,8
1939,to store our data.,8
1940,These photographic plates,8
1941,were incredibly difficult to work with.,8
1942,One side of them was treated,8
1943,with a chemical emulsion that would darken,8
1944,when it was exposed to light.,8
1945,This is how these plates were able,8
1946,"to store the pictures that they took,",8
1947,but it meant that astronomers,8
1948,had to work with these plates in darkness.,8
1949,The plates had to be cut,8
1950,to a specific size,8
1951,so that they could fit,8
1952,into the camera of a telescope.,8
1953,So astronomers would take,8
1954,razor-sharp cutting tools,8
1955,"and slice these tiny pieces of glass,",8
1956,all in the dark.,8
1957,Astronomers also had all kinds of tricks,8
1958,that they would use,8
1959,to make the plates,8
1960,respond to light a little faster.,8
1961,"They would bake them or freeze them,",8
1962,"they would soak them in ammonia,",8
1963,or they'd coat them with lemon juice —,8
1964,all in the dark.,8
1965,Then astronomers would take,8
1966,these carefully designed plates,8
1967,to the telescope,8
1968,and load them into the camera.,8
1969,They had to be loaded with that,8
1970,chemically emulsified side pointed out,8
1971,so that the light would hit it.,8
1972,"But in the dark, it was almost impossible",8
1973,to tell which side was the right one.,8
1974,Astronomers got into the habit,8
1975,"of tapping a plate to their lips,",8
1976,"or, like, licking it, to see",8
1977,which side of the plate was sticky,8
1978,and therefore coated with the emulsion.,8
1979,And then when they actually,8
1980,"put it into the camera,",8
1981,there was one last challenge.,8
1982,"In this picture behind me,",8
1983,you can see that the plate,8
1984,the astronomer is holding,8
1985,is very slightly curved.,8
1986,Sometimes plates had to be bent,8
1987,"to fit into a telescope's camera,",8
1988,"so you would take this carefully cut,",8
1989,"meticulously treated, very babied plate",8
1990,"up to a telescope, and then you'd just ...",8
1991,So sometimes that would work.,8
1992,Sometimes they would snap.,8
1993,But it would usually end,8
1994,with the [plate] loaded into a camera,8
1995,on the back of a telescope.,8
1996,You could then point that telescope,8
1997,to whatever patch of sky,8
1998,"you wanted to study,",8
1999,"open the camera shutter,",8
2000,and begin capturing data.,8
2001,"Now, astronomers couldn't just",8
2002,walk away from the camera,8
2003,once they'd done this.,8
2004,They had to stay with that camera,8
2005,for as long as they were observing.,8
2006,This meant that astronomers,8
2007,would get into elevators,8
2008,attached to the side,8
2009,of the telescope domes.,8
2010,They would ride the elevator,8
2011,high into the building,8
2012,and then climb into,8
2013,the top of the telescope,8
2014,and stay there all night,8
2015,"shivering in the cold,",8
2017,"in and out of the camera,",8
2018,opening and closing the shutter,8
2019,and pointing the telescope,8
2020,to whatever piece of sky,8
2021,they wanted to study.,8
2022,These astronomers worked with operators,8
2023,who would stay on the ground.,8
2024,And they would do things,8
2025,like turn the dome itself,8
2026,and make sure the rest,8
2027,of the telescope was running.,8
2028,It was a system that usually,8
2029,"worked pretty well,",8
2030,"but once in a while,",8
2031,things would go wrong.,8
2032,There was an astronomer observing,8
2033,a very complicated plate,8
2034,"at this observatory,",8
2035,the Lick Observatory here in California.,8
2036,He was sitting at the top,8
2037,of that yellow structure,8
2038,that you see in the dome,8
2039,"on the lower right,",8
2040,and he'd been exposing,8
2041,"one glass plate to the sky for hours,",8
2042,crouched down and cold,8
2043,and keeping the telescope,8
2045,so he could take this precious,8
2046,picture of the universe.,8
2047,His operator wandered,8
2048,into the dome at one point,8
2049,just to check on him,8
2050,and see how things were going.,8
2051,And as the operator stepped through,8
2052,"the door of the dome,",8
2053,he brushed against the wall,8
2054,and flipped the light switch in the dome.,8
2055,So the lights came blazing on,8
2056,and flooding into the telescope,8
2057,"and ruining the plate,",8
2058,and there was then this howl,8
2059,from the top of the telescope.,8
2060,The astronomer started yelling,8
2061,"and cursing and saying,",8
2062,"""""What have you done?",8
2063,You've destroyed so much hard work.,8
2064,I'm going to get down,8
2065,"from this telescope and kill you!""""",8
2066,So he then starts moving the telescope,8
2067,about this fast —,8
2069,toward the elevator,8
2070,so that he can climb down,8
2071,and make good on his threats.,8
2072,"Now, as he's approaching the elevator,",8
2073,the elevator then suddenly,8
2074,"starts spinning away from him,",8
2075,"because remember, the astronomer",8
2076,"can control the telescope,",8
2077,but the operator can control the dome.,8
2079,"And the operator is looking up, going,",8
2080,"""""He seems really mad. I might not want",8
2081,"to let him down until he's less murdery.""""",8
2082,So the end is this absurd,8
2083,slow-motion game of chase,8
2084,with the lights on and the dome,8
2085,just spinning around and around.,8
2086,It must have looked completely ridiculous.,8
2087,When I tell people about using,8
2088,"photographic plates to study the universe,",8
2089,it does sound ridiculous.,8
2090,It's a little absurd,8
2091,to take what seems like a primitive tool,8
2092,for studying the universe,8
2093,"and say, well, we're going",8
2094,"to dunk this in lemon juice, lick it,",8
2095,"stick it in the telescope,",8
2096,shiver next to it for a few hours,8
2097,and solve the mysteries of the cosmos.,8
2098,"In reality, though,",8
2099,that's exactly what we did.,8
2100,I showed you this picture before,8
2101,of an astronomer perched,8
2102,at the top of a telescope.,8
2103,What I didn't tell you,8
2104,is who this astronomer is.,8
2105,"This is Edwin Hubble,",8
2106,and Hubble used photographic plates,8
2107,to completely change,8
2108,our entire understanding,8
2109,of how big the universe is,8
2110,and how it works.,8
2111,This is a plate,8
2112,that Hubble took back in 1923,8
2113,of an object known at the time,8
2114,as the Andromeda Nebula.,8
2115,You can see in the upper,8
2116,right of that image,8
2117,that Hubble has labeled a star,8
2118,"with this bright red word, """"Var!""""",8
2119,He's even put an exclamation,8
2120,point next to it.,8
2121,"""""Var"""" here stands for """"variable.""""",8
2122,Hubble had found a variable star,8
2123,in the Andromeda Nebula.,8
2124,"Its brightness changed,",8
2125,getting brighter and dimmer,8
2126,as a function of time.,8
2127,Hubble knew that if he studied,8
2128,"how that star changed with time,",8
2129,he could measure the distance,8
2130,"to the Andromeda Nebula,",8
2131,"and when he did,",8
2132,the results were astonishing.,8
2133,"He discovered that this was not,",8
2134,"in fact, a nebula.",8
2135,"This was the Andromeda Galaxy,",8
2136,an entire separate galaxy,8
2137,two and a half million light years,8
2138,beyond our own Milky Way.,8
2139,This was the first evidence,8
2140,of other galaxies,8
2141,"existing in the universe beyond our own,",8
2142,and it totally changed our understanding,8
2143,of how big the universe was,8
2144,and what it contained.,8
2145,So now we can look at,8
2146,what telescopes can do today.,8
2147,This is a modern-day picture,8
2148,"of the Andromeda Galaxy,",8
2149,and it looks just like,8
2150,the telescope photos,8
2151,that we all love to enjoy and look at:,8
2152,it's colorful and detailed and beautiful.,8
2153,"We now store data like this digitally,",8
2154,and we take it using,8
2155,telescopes like these.,8
2156,So this is me standing underneath,8
2157,a telescope with a mirror,8
2158,that's 26 feet across.,8
2159,Bigger telescope mirrors let us take,8
2160,"sharper and clearer images,",8
2161,and they also make it,8
2162,easier for us to gather light,8
2163,from faint and faraway objects.,8
2164,So a bigger telescope literally,8
2165,gives us a farther reach,8
2166,"into the universe,",8
2167,looking at things that we,8
2168,couldn't have seen before.,8
2169,We're also no longer strapped,8
2170,to the telescope,8
2171,when we do our observations.,8
2172,This is me during,8
2173,my very first observing trip,8
2174,at a telescope in Arizona.,8
2175,"I'm opening the dome of the telescope,",8
2176,but I'm not on top,8
2177,of the telescope to do it.,8
2178,I'm sitting in a room,8
2179,"off to the side of the dome,",8
2180,nice and warm and on the ground,8
2181,and running the telescope from afar.,8
2182,"""""Afar"""" can get pretty extreme.",8
2183,Sometimes we don't even need,8
2184,to go to telescopes anymore.,8
2185,This is a telescope in New Mexico,8
2186,"that I use for my research all the time,",8
2187,but I can run it with my laptop.,8
2188,I can sit on my couch in Seattle,8
2189,and send commands from my laptop,8
2190,"telling the telescope where to point,",8
2191,"when to open and close the shutter,",8
2192,what pictures I want it,8
2193,to take of the universe —,8
2194,all from many states away.,8
2195,So the way that we operate,8
2196,"telescopes has really changed,",8
2197,but the questions we're trying to answer,8
2198,about the universe,8
2199,have remained the same.,8
2200,One of the big questions still focuses,8
2201,"on how things change in the night sky,",8
2202,and the changing sky was exactly,8
2203,what Oscar Duhalde saw,8
2204,when he looked up,8
2205,with the naked eye in 1987.,8
2206,This point of light that he saw appearing,8
2207,in the Large Magellanic Cloud,8
2208,turned out to be a supernova.,8
2209,This was the first naked-eye supernova,8
2210,seen from Earth in more than 400 years.,8
2211,"This is pretty cool,",8
2212,but a couple of you might,8
2213,"be looking at this image and going,",8
2214,"""""Really? I've heard of supernovae.",8
2215,"They're supposed to be spectacular,",8
2216,and this is just like a dot,8
2217,"that appeared in the sky.""""",8
2218,It's true that when you hear,8
2219,the description of what a supernova is,8
2220,it sounds really epic.,8
2221,"They're these brilliant, explosive deaths",8
2222,"of enormous, massive stars,",8
2223,and they shoot energy,8
2224,"out into the universe,",8
2225,"and they spew material out into space,",8
2226,"and they sound, like, noticeable.",8
2227,They sound really obvious.,8
2228,The whole trick about,8
2229,what a supernova looks like,8
2230,has to do with where it is.,8
2231,If a star were to die as a supernova,8
2232,"right in our backyard in the Milky Way,",8
2233,a few hundred light years away —,8
2234,"""""backyard"""" in astronomy terms —",8
2235,it would be incredibly bright.,8
2236,We would be able to see,8
2237,that supernova at night,8
2238,as bright as the Moon.,8
2239,We would be able to read by its light.,8
2240,Everybody would wind up taking photos,8
2241,of this supernova on their phone.,8
2242,It would be on headlines,8
2243,all over the world.,8
2244,It would for sure get a hashtag.,8
2245,It would be impossible to miss,8
2246,that a supernova had happened so nearby.,8
2247,But the supernova that Oscar observed,8
2248,didn't happen a few hundred,8
2249,light years away.,8
2250,This supernova happened,8
2251,"170,000 light years away,",8
2252,"which is why instead of an epic explosion,",8
2253,it appears as a little dot.,8
2254,This was still unbelievably exciting.,8
2255,"It was still visible with the naked eye,",8
2256,and the most spectacular supernova,8
2257,that we've seen since,8
2258,the invention of the telescope.,8
2259,But it gives you a better sense,8
2260,of what most supernovae look like.,8
2261,We still discover and study,8
2262,"supernovae all the time today,",8
2263,but we do it in distant galaxies,8
2264,using powerful telescopes.,8
2265,"We photograph the galaxy multiple times,",8
2266,and we look for something that's changed.,8
2267,We look for that little,8
2268,pinprick of light appearing,8
2269,that tells us that a star has died.,8
2270,We can learn a great deal,8
2271,about the universe and about stars,8
2273,but we don't want to leave,8
2274,studying them up to chance.,8
2275,We don't want to count on,8
2276,happening to look up at the right time,8
2277,or pointing our telescope,8
2278,at the right galaxy.,8
2279,What we ideally want is a telescope,8
2280,that can systematically,8
2282,do what Oscar did with his mind.,8
2283,Oscar was able to discover this supernova,8
2284,because he had that galaxy memorized.,8
2285,"With digital data,",8
2286,we can effectively memorize,8
2287,"every piece of the sky that we look at,",8
2288,compare old and new observations,8
2289,and look for anything that's changed.,8
2290,This is the Vera Rubin Observatory,8
2292,"Now, when I visited it back in March,",8
2293,it was still under construction.,8
2294,But this telescope,8
2295,"will begin observations next year,",8
2296,"and when it does,",8
2297,it will carry out a simple,8
2298,but spectacular observing program.,8
2299,This telescope will photograph,8
2300,the entire southern sky,8
2301,every few days,8
2302,"over and over,",8
2303,following a preset pattern,8
2304,for 10 years.,8
2305,Computers and algorithms,8
2306,affiliated with the observatory,8
2307,will then compare every pair of images,8
2308,"taken of the same patch of sky,",8
2309,looking for anything,8
2310,"that's gotten brighter or dimmer,",8
2311,"like a variable star,",8
2312,"or looking for anything that's appeared,",8
2313,like a supernova.,8
2314,"Right now, we discover about",8
2315,a thousand supernovae every year.,8
2316,The Rubin Observatory will be capable,8
2317,of discovering a thousand supernovae,8
2319,It's going to dramatically change,8
2320,the face of astronomy,8
2321,and of how we study things,8
2322,"that change in the sky,",8
2323,and it will do all of this,8
2324,largely without much,8
2325,human intervention at all.,8
2326,It will follow that preset pattern,8
2327,and computationally find,8
2328,anything that's changed or appeared.,8
2329,"This might sound a little sad at first,",8
2330,this idea that we're removing,8
2331,people from stargazing.,8
2332,"But in reality,",8
2333,our role as astronomers,8
2335,it's just moving.,8
2336,We've already seen,8
2337,how we do our jobs change.,8
2338,We've gone from perching atop telescopes,8
2339,to sitting next to them,8
2340,to not even needing to go to them,8
2341,or send them commands at all.,8
2342,Where astronomers still shine,8
2343,is in asking questions,8
2344,and working with the data.,8
2345,Gathering data is only the first step.,8
2346,Analyzing it is where we can really apply,8
2347,what we know about the universe.,8
2348,Human curiosity is what makes us,8
2349,ask questions like:,8
2350,How big is the universe?,8
2351,How did it begin?,8
2352,How's it going to end? And are we alone?,8
2353,So this is the power that humans,8
2354,are still able to bring to astronomy.,8
2355,So compare the capabilities,8
2356,of a telescope like this,8
2357,with the observations,8
2358,that we were able to take like this.,8
2359,We discovered amazing things,8
2360,"with glass plates,",8
2361,but discovery looks different today.,8
2362,The way we do astronomy,8
2363,looks different today.,8
2364,What hasn't changed,8
2365,is that seed of human curiosity.,8
2366,If we can harness the power,8
2367,of tomorrow's technology,8
2368,and combine it with this drive,8
2369,that we all have to look up,8
2370,and to ask questions,8
2371,"about what we see there,",8
2372,we'll be ready to learn,8
2373,some incredible new things,8
2374,about the universe.,8
2377,"Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Ajay Banga,",9
2378,thank you so much for being with us today.,9
2379,I feel like this conversation,9
2380,is especially meaningful,9
2381,as we're wading through,9
2382,"this pandemic, it's late 2020,",9
2383,and we've seen the way that inequalities,9
2384,have presented themselves,9
2385,"throughout this year, through this crisis.",9
2386,And since you've been,9
2387,"at the helm of Mastercard,",9
2388,you have championed this idea,9
2389,of financial inclusion.,9
2390,"And so, could you start",9
2391,by telling us a little bit,9
2392,"about financial inclusion,",9
2393,what is it,9
2394,and why do you think this is something,9
2395,that can change people's lives?,9
2396,"Ajay Banga: Yes, look,",9
2397,I think that the COVID-19 crisis,9
2398,has actually made things,9
2399,worse in some ways,9
2400,and some of the advances,9
2401,that were being made,9
2402,over the prior decade,9
2403,on fighting poverty and fighting exclusion,9
2404,"have probably got set back a little bit,",9
2405,just by the nature of the manner,9
2406,in which the virus has impacted,9
2407,minorities and disadvantaged people,9
2408,"more than they have others,",9
2409,"including, by the way,",9
2411,a number of whom have had,9
2413,through the crisis.,9
2414,But I guess if you pull back,9
2415,"from the crisis,",9
2416,because financial inclusion or exclusion,9
2417,is an underlying social problem,9
2418,that dates back to well before this.,9
2419,"The real issue,",9
2420,here's the theory of the case.,9
2421,"Of seven billion people in the world,",9
2422,close to two billion are either,9
2423,underbanked or unbanked in some way.,9
2424,And what I mean,9
2425,by underbanked or unbanked —,9
2426,"unbanked is obvious,",9
2427,they don't have a relationship,9
2428,with a banking institution of any type.,9
2429,Of any type.,9
2430,"Now, underbanked is, even if they do,",9
2431,they're not getting to participate,9
2432,in the financial mainstream,9
2433,and do things that you and I,9
2434,"take for granted,",9
2435,which means being able to access credit,9
2436,"when you need it, at a reasonable price,",9
2437,being able to access insurance,9
2438,"of the type that's relevant to you,",9
2439,"being able to do things of that nature,",9
2440,save for a rainy day in the right way.,9
2441,All that done in a form,9
2442,that's good for you as the consumer.,9
2444,"And so, a couple of billion",9
2445,"people around the world,",9
2446,"this is World Bank statistics,",9
2447,"are basically unbanked or underbanked,",9
2448,and most of those people,9
2449,do not have a formal identity,9
2450,that they had received,9
2451,or got from their government,9
2452,"and therefore, there's nothing",9
2453,they can take and hold out,9
2454,to show when they go to hire a car,9
2455,or live in a hotel,9
2456,"or take a flight, which they don't do,",9
2457,to show that they exist in the system.,9
2458,"Their opinions don't count,",9
2459,they don't get counted,9
2460,"in censuses very often,",9
2461,they don't get counted for their opinion,9
2462,"of what government should be doing,",9
2463,"they get left out, they're locked out.",9
2464,And the last part of that puzzle,9
2465,"is that this is too big an issue,",9
2466,"over the years,",9
2467,"for just a government to solve,",9
2468,or for just one bank,9
2469,to solve in a country.,9
2470,"It does require, kind of,",9
2471,a bunch of shoulders at the wheel,9
2472,"to come together,",9
2473,it requires partnerships across,9
2474,"the public and the private sector,",9
2475,"but even within the private sector,",9
2476,to get to make a real,9
2477,movement on this issue.,9
2478,"WPR: So if I'm understanding correctly,",9
2479,it sounds like it's just an opportunity,9
2480,"for people no matter where you are,",9
2481,"what your socioeconomic status is,",9
2482,that you have access,9
2483,"to financial services,",9
2484,that you are part of the system,9
2485,"and you have a place,",9
2486,a financial identity.,9
2487,"AB: You have identity, you have a voice,",9
2488,you have access to financial services.,9
2489,So financial inclusion,9
2490,"has got so many facets,",9
2491,but the basic facet is,9
2492,"be counted, be included,",9
2493,"be somebody, have the dignity",9
2494,"of your identity,",9
2495,and of being included.,9
2496,That's really what financial inclusion is.,9
2497,"WPR: It seems like such a simple idea,",9
2498,"that can potentially have a big impact,",9
2499,and I know that this is something,9
2500,that you've implemented,9
2501,"in your work at Mastercard,",9
2502,but also we see this,9
2503,"in many other organizations,",9
2504,so talk a little bit about what does,9
2505,financial inclusion look like in practice,9
2506,for a range of different organizations,9
2507,and a range of different spaces.,9
2508,"AB: First of all,",9
2509,"you're absolutely correct,",9
2510,there are lots of people participating,9
2511,in trying to change this.,9
2512,"And honestly, without that,",9
2513,we wouldn't get anywhere.,9
2514,"We're doing our bit,",9
2515,but what we're doing,9
2516,"is really in partnership with others,",9
2517,because we're not,9
2518,a direct-to-consumer company.,9
2519,There's nothing I can do,9
2520,to improve your life directly,9
2521,in terms of being included,9
2522,"because I don't open bank accounts,",9
2523,"I don't give credit,",9
2524,I don't underwrite insurance,9
2525,and I don't have a way,9
2526,to provide you ways to save money,9
2527,in a mutual fund or anything.,9
2528,"For me to do anything,",9
2529,"I need to have banks,",9
2530,"I need to have fintechs,",9
2531,"I need to have mobile phone companies,",9
2532,"I need to have governments,",9
2533,I probably need to have merchants,9
2534,and that ecosystem,9
2535,of the coalition of the willing,9
2536,is kind of what you will see represented,9
2537,when different companies,9
2538,talk about their role,9
2539,in financial inclusion.,9
2540,Let me give you,9
2541,a couple of tangible examples.,9
2542,So if you're a farmer,9
2543,and you've got to go to sell,9
2544,"your produce when it's harvested,",9
2545,you've got to go two days' way,9
2546,"to the nearest village market,",9
2547,"well then, everybody knows",9
2548,that on the way back you're carrying cash,9
2549,from the produce you sold.,9
2550,That normally leads to bad outcomes.,9
2551,"Also, you've got to go buy fertilizer.",9
2552,Or you've got to go,9
2553,back and forth to do all this,9
2554,"and you're really unproductive,",9
2555,or you send your spouse to do it.,9
2556,All that changes if I can connect you,9
2557,with a phone,9
2558,"into farmers, fertilizers",9
2560,"give you cropping information,",9
2562,enable you to sell your produce,9
2563,"in a better marketplace, online,",9
2564,"receive the money into an account online,",9
2565,that is a complete game changer.,9
2567,"that farmer's cooperatives,",9
2569,banks and companies like ours,9
2570,"can help facilitate,",9
2571,"in Africa, we're doing it in India,",9
2572,we're doing it in a bunch,9
2573,of countries around the world.,9
2574,"Again, the idea here",9
2575,is to take you out of the cash economy,9
2576,and give you access,9
2577,to an electronic economy.,9
2578,"Imagine that same farmer,",9
2579,"they now receive money for their produce,",9
2580,a bank can look at how they spend money,9
2581,"out of their account,",9
2582,"and could, using the spending",9
2583,"and receiving of money,",9
2584,underwrite you much better for a crop loan,9
2585,than they could if they,9
2586,didn't know anything about you.,9
2587,"So the same example, another one,",9
2588,is for small and microbusinesses.,9
2589,Take a woman in Kenya,9
2590,or in India or in Mexico in a village,9
2591,who opens a small shop outside her home,9
2592,when her husband and children are away.,9
2593,"And it runs for a few hours in a day,",9
2594,"and she stocks a little baby food,",9
2595,and soap and toilet paper,9
2596,and whatever else people buy there.,9
2597,"Well when the company van comes,",9
2598,"the Nestle van, the Unilever van,",9
2599,"the local Bimbo Bread van,",9
2600,comes to sell produce to her,9
2601,on a Monday or a Tuesday,9
2602,"or a Wednesday at a certain time,",9
2603,she buys what she can in cash.,9
2604,"Typically, she's in the cash economy,",9
2605,"nobody’s given her credit,",9
2606,she runs out of cash,9
2607,for that produce that she's buying,9
2608,before the week is over.,9
2609,She's out of stock. She loses sales.,9
2610,"Imagine if she could then be underwritten,",9
2611,"digitizing that supply chain,",9
2612,"what she bought, what she sold,",9
2613,underwrite her in a bank,9
2614,"with actual transaction history,",9
2615,you could lend her the 500 dollars,9
2616,to enable her to be smarter,9
2617,"about what she buys,",9
2618,"educate her on how to use her credit,",9
2619,that's financial inclusion.,9
2620,WPR: And so one thing,9
2621,that's really struck me,9
2622,as you're talking through,9
2623,what financial inclusion looks like,9
2624,"and how it works,",9
2625,"is the dependency on technology,",9
2626,"on smartphones, on internet access,",9
2627,and we know that this is something,9
2628,that a lot of people,9
2629,struggle to have access to this,9
2630,"in developing nations,",9
2631,even in developed countries.,9
2632,Talk a little bit about how this might,9
2633,"in some ways increase the digital divide,",9
2634,"and sort of, how you respond",9
2635,to people who might criticize,9
2636,this idea in that way.,9
2637,AB: There are two topics,9
2638,"you just came across,",9
2639,"the digital divide,",9
2640,which I think is a real issue.,9
2641,"But just to be clear,",9
2642,"all the examples I gave you,",9
2643,they work on smartphones,9
2644,and they work on old flip phones as well.,9
2645,"That QR code, if you have",9
2646,"a camera on your smartphone,",9
2647,"you can take it,",9
2648,"but there's a numerical number there,",9
2649,you could enter that number,9
2650,into your finger phone,9
2651,and get it across as well.,9
2652,"Examples like that in Egypt,",9
2653,where we've opened,9
2654,"mobile wallets on phones,",9
2655,"they don't have to be on a smartphone,",9
2656,it could be on an old phone.,9
2657,"So to be clear, these financial",9
2659,"do not depend on smartphones,",9
2660,they do not depend on just,9
2661,"internet access in your house,",9
2662,"you do need a phone, a cell phone,",9
2663,in a number of the examples I gave you.,9
2664,But in the case of the micro,9
2665,"and small credit enterprises,",9
2666,you don't even need a phone.,9
2667,That actually is just,9
2668,the transaction history,9
2669,of the produce you bought,9
2670,and what you sold getting digitized,9
2671,and a bank being able to underwrite.,9
2672,There are other problems,9
2673,of infrastructure in those,9
2674,that we can talk about.,9
2675,But to be specific,9
2676,"about the digital divide,",9
2677,I think that's another real big issue,9
2678,"and again, COVID-19",9
2679,"has actually, unfortunately,",9
2680,exposed what was already,9
2681,sort of an issue in society.,9
2682,"So whether it's rural parts of America,",9
2683,let alone an African or Indian,9
2684,"or Indonesian or Guatemalan example,",9
2685,"in America, in rural parts of America,",9
2686,broadband access is a problem.,9
2687,"Disadvantaged children in New York City,",9
2688,who may not have access,9
2689,to the same bandwidth capacity,9
2690,or computers that they need,9
2691,"to be able to participate in education,",9
2692,that's a problem.,9
2693,"And so, that's a separate issue, Whitney,",9
2694,from the issue of some,9
2695,"of the examples I gave you,",9
2696,which I think can actually,9
2697,be operated equally well,9
2698,with old-fashioned phones.,9
2699,WPR: It seems like a precursor to this,9
2700,is in talking about these partnerships,9
2701,"with governments, perhaps,",9
2702,is making sure people do have,9
2703,even access to a flip phone,9
2704,or some sort of way,9
2705,that they can communicate,9
2706,so they can participate,9
2707,in these initiatives.,9
2708,AB: So I think a phone is transformational,9
2709,and the fact is that there are many,9
2710,"people in the world with a phone,",9
2711,but there's still a billion people,9
2712,who do not have the right kind,9
2713,of phone or internet access.,9
2714,That's a different topic.,9
2715,"So that said, you've got to find ways",9
2716,to reach them too.,9
2717,You can't only do it by phone.,9
2718,So the example of those micro SMEs,9
2719,"I was talking about,",9
2720,they've got nothing to do with a phone.,9
2721,"Or for example, in South Africa,",9
2722,with the social security administration,9
2723,where the government gives them,9
2724,a certain amount of money every year,9
2725,"for their being not employed,",9
2726,you can actually reach them,9
2727,"through a biometric card,",9
2728,"which is what we've done,",9
2729,"with the government,",9
2730,"the government collects your identity,",9
2731,"your biometrics on a card,",9
2732,and we can load the card remotely,9
2733,"with the amount they want to transfer,",9
2734,"take out the middleman in the process,",9
2735,and allow that person,9
2736,to then use that card to go to an ATM,9
2737,"to take out their cash,",9
2738,or go straight to a shop to shop.,9
2739,And I think that changes everything.,9
2740,So we've done that in many countries.,9
2741,And so if you go to where Syrian refugees,9
2742,were coming in to Lebanon,9
2743,"and Greece and the like,",9
2744,every aid agency there,9
2745,would require them,9
2746,to have an identity with them,9
2747,to get access to whatever form of aid,9
2748,they were dispersing.,9
2749,One of the things we're doing,9
2750,is to convert that,9
2751,into a very simple,9
2753,"which will be read across aid agencies,",9
2754,so you or I don't need to get,9
2755,our identity verified,9
2756,separately each time.,9
2757,There is a statistic in the world,9
2758,that 40 percent of the dollars,9
2759,that governments want to spend,9
2760,to reach their citizenry,9
2761,for social benefit programs,9
2762,never reach them.,9
2763,They are called leakage.,9
2764,Leakage means administrative costs,9
2765,and I call it theft.,9
2766,Because it's 40 less cents on a dollar,9
2767,for the person who cannot afford,9
2768,even one cent less.,9
2769,That's the issue.,9
2770,That's what we're trying to solve for.,9
2771,"Take out middlemen,",9
2772,"use technology to help,",9
2773,enable a direct government,9
2774,"to citizenry operation,",9
2775,allow banks and NGOs and foreign companies,9
2776,"to intervene in the right way,",9
2777,as in the example of this refugee crisis.,9
2778,The World Food Programme distributes food,9
2779,in those very refugee camps.,9
2780,And we actually help them,9
2781,"to take the food,",9
2782,they would buy grain somewhere,9
2783,"and ship it across,",9
2784,"and lose some of it along the way,",9
2785,"we put the dollar value on a card,",9
2786,the card can only be used by the refugee,9
2787,in a shop that the World,9
2788,Food Programme certifies.,9
2789,So it cannot be used for anything,9
2790,other than what the World,9
2791,"Food Programme wants it used for,",9
2792,which is grain and food,9
2793,and vegetables and fruit and milk.,9
2794,And that enables the World Food Programme,9
2795,to save money on leakage.,9
2796,What I'm trying to tell you,9
2797,"is it's not about technology,",9
2798,it's about using what you have,9
2799,and using the technology you do possess,9
2800,"and applying that in a smart,",9
2801,commercially sustainable way,9
2802,to real world problems.,9
2803,"If you have good technology as well,",9
2804,well let's do it even better.,9
2805,But let's not use technology,9
2806,as the excuse to not do it.,9
2807,WPR: OK. It makes a lot of sense now.,9
2808,It seems like underlying all of this,9
2809,is this move towards a cashless society.,9
2810,This move to sort of create,9
2811,this way for people to exchange money,9
2812,without the need for cash.,9
2813,I'm curious to hear from you a little bit,9
2814,"about what does that actually look like,",9
2815,"you know, a society without cash.",9
2816,What are some of the challenges,9
2817,that is presents?,9
2818,"AB: Yeah, I think cashless, actually,",9
2819,"is something we are not going to get to,",9
2820,and we probably shouldn't.,9
2821,"Because just as we have a digital divide,",9
2822,do you really want a world,9
2823,where people who rely on cash,9
2824,"because it makes them comfortable,",9
2825,I'm not talking,9
2826,"about illegal transactions,",9
2827,I'm talking about somebody,9
2828,"who just wants to deal in cash,",9
2829,they may be older and uncomfortable,9
2830,with today's technology.,9
2831,"My dad, when he was alive,",9
2832,"you know, he never wanted to use a card.",9
2833,He always wanted to use a cash and check.,9
2834,"And this is my father,",9
2835,when I worked in banking,9
2836,"and was by then the CEO of Mastercard,",9
2837,and he would look at me,9
2838,"very indulgently and say,",9
2839,"""""Son, now I have a Mastercard",9
2840,"because of you,",9
2841,"but could you please go away""""",9
2842,kind of thing.,9
2843,And I understand that.,9
2844,And I think you've got to deal,9
2845,"with therefore """"cashless,""""",9
2846,in inverted commas.,9
2847,Reducing cash in the economy,9
2848,is to me a good objective.,9
2849,Taking it to zero?,9
2850,I'm not there.,9
2851,Why do I say it's a good,9
2852,objective to reduce it?,9
2853,Because cash actually is the friend,9
2854,of the person who has something to hide.,9
2855,"If you want to not pay your full taxes,",9
2856,or you want to do something with the cash,9
2857,"which is not quite kosher,",9
2858,"well guess what, here's your chance.",9
2859,"But if you're electronic,",9
2860,you are transparent.,9
2861,Electronic forms of money,9
2862,"benefits and transfers in utilization,",9
2863,create transparency in an economy.,9
2865,"they don't have access to cash,",9
2866,"and therefore, they don't",9
2867,indulge any of this.,9
2868,"But even other than that,",9
2869,"even other than all this,",9
2870,there is a cost of cash in society,9
2871,"which many people have computed,",9
2872,"central banks, universities,",9
2873,somewhere between one to two,9
2874,percent of GDP,9
2875,"is the cost of printing, securing,",9
2876,distributing and using that cash.,9
2877,One to two percent of GDP.,9
2878,I'm certain there are efficient,9
2879,uses of that GDP,9
2880,that we could put into play,9
2881,by reducing the role of cash,9
2882,relatively in the economy.,9
2883,"In the process,",9
2884,you take out these middlemen,9
2885,who are in positions of power,9
2886,"when social benefits are distributed,",9
2887,when refugees are met.,9
2888,That's what I'm talking about.,9
2889,That to me is a good thing.,9
2890,"Transparent, better tax realizations,",9
2891,"lower money laundering,",9
2892,"that kind of stuff I'm all for,",9
2893,and I've been talking,9
2894,about that for years.,9
2895,"But zero cash, I'm not there.",9
2896,WPR: And do you think there is a point,9
2897,"where you do get there,",9
2898,"or we get there as a society,",9
2899,where that does feel possible?,9
2900,AB: We could.,9
2901,"I mean, if you took countries",9
2902,"in the Nordics, take Sweden.",9
2903,"Sweden, South Korea,",9
2904,these are at the cutting edge,9
2905,of having reduced cash in their economies.,9
2906,"In Sweden, essentially everybody uses",9
2907,"electronic forms of payments,",9
2908,either a card or app on their phone,9
2909,that they can swish through,9
2910,"or things of that nature,",9
2911,consumer payments I'm talking about.,9
2912,Even public toilets,9
2913,on the street in Sweden,9
2914,you can pay by on your phone,9
2915,"entering a code,",9
2916,"which comes back to you,",9
2917,having deducted that money,9
2918,from your account.,9
2919,You enter the code on a pin pad,9
2920,"and I call that tap and go,",9
2921,you go into the public toilet,9
2922,with that tap.,9
2923,That's how far it's advanced in Sweden.,9
2924,So cash is very low there.,9
2925,"But even they are having a regular,",9
2926,continuous public conversation,9
2927,about not disadvantaging,9
2928,those parts of Sweden,9
2929,who still want to deal in cash.,9
2930,"You've got to be careful,",9
2931,because remember how does cash reach,9
2932,distributed points in a country?,9
2933,"Through banks, through ATMs.",9
2934,If those become unprofitable to run,9
2935,"and people start closing the ATMs down,",9
2936,that's a problem in itself.,9
2937,So you have to enable,9
2938,"cash back in retailers in some way,",9
2939,so that you could still go and get cash,9
2940,from a distribution system.,9
2941,"Maybe not an ATM, but a retailer.",9
2942,"There are some ways to do this well,",9
2943,but you've got to be conscious of it.,9
2944,"You know, we haven't reached it yet,",9
2945,but we could.,9
2946,We haven't reached it yet.,9
2947,"WPR: Of course, when you think about this,",9
2948,about moving to a cashless society,9
2949,"or at least having that as the goal,",9
2950,that creates this concern,9
2951,around data and privacy,9
2952,and you've said in the past,9
2953,that there's really an importance,9
2954,behind putting consumers in control,9
2955,of their own data and their own privacy.,9
2956,How is that something,9
2957,"that we can actually achieve,",9
2958,what does it look like to do that?,9
2959,"AB: Whitney, it's a terrific question.",9
2960,I actually believe that it's at the core,9
2961,of a lot to do with the next,9
2962,"10, 20 years of technology,",9
2963,"the internet of things, 5G, data,",9
2964,this is all coming together,9
2965,"at warp speed, right?",9
2966,If you think about the number of devices,9
2967,that are going to be connected,9
2968,"over the next five, ten years,",9
2969,and what 5G could do,9
2970,to moving intelligent computing,9
2971,"to the edge right near you,",9
2972,this is going to generate,9
2973,enormous amounts of data.,9
2974,"From your fridge, from your car,",9
2975,"from you walking around,",9
2976,"from your connected glasses,",9
2977,"from your watch already, all that.",9
2978,From your shoes if you're a runner.,9
2979,So you've got to get to a stage,9
2980,where we take a responsibility,9
2981,of how your data is used and interpreted.,9
2982,"And so, Mastercard,",9
2983,"we with a bunch of companies,",9
2984,we have laid out a set of data principles.,9
2985,The first one is exactly what you said.,9
2986,"It's your data, you should control it.",9
2987,Meaning you should know,9
2988,"what's being collected,",9
2989,"you should be able to say,",9
2990,"""""I don't want that to be collected,""""",9
2991,"in simple language,",9
2992,not in a 12-page legal agreement,9
2993,that you cannot comprehend.,9
2994,And you should be able to benefit,9
2995,"from that data of yours that is used,",9
2996,"either directly, or indirectly",9
2997,in some way that you comprehend.,9
2998,And if I as a company,9
2999,am collecting your data,9
3000,"to enable me to do business with you,",9
3001,I should collect the minimum amount I need,9
3002,to do my job with you,9
3003,and I should keep,9
3004,"whatever I collect safe for you,",9
3005,and allow it to be deducted,9
3006,or removed when you want it.,9
3007,These are not complicated things.,9
3008,"Your data, you're in control,",9
3009,you should be able,9
3010,"to delete it when you want,",9
3011,you should know what's being collected.,9
3012,"If I do anything with you,",9
3013,"collect the minimum, keep it safe.",9
3014,Consumers will vote,9
3015,with their feet on this topic.,9
3016,"As they get more knowledgeable,",9
3017,"as they get more educated,",9
3018,"and that's the right thing to do,",9
3019,"they need to say, """"I don't want you",9
3020,to use my data for the following things.,9
3021,"I want to know what it's being used for.""""",9
3022,Putting consumer back,9
3023,in control of their data,9

3027,"WPR: Thank you so much, Ajay,",9
3028,this was a great conversation,9

3030,"AB: Thanks a lot, see you again.",9
3032,"Liz Ogbu: So Lisa,",10
3033,Apple is on target,10
3034,to become carbon neutral,10
3035,across its entire business,10
3036,and manufacturing supply chain,10
3038,Can you explain exactly what that means?,10
3039,Lisa Jackson: Sure.,10
3040,So today Apple is carbon neutral,10
3041,for all of our own operations.,10
3042,And we're running,10
3043,on 100 percent renewable energy,10
3044,"for our corporate campuses,",10
3045,for our stores,10
3046,and for our data centers.,10
3047,So we know how to do this work.,10
3048,The challenge for 2030,10
3049,"is to convert our supply chain,",10
3050,and that work has already begun.,10
3051,"We already have 70 suppliers,",10
3052,over eight gigawatts,10
3053,of energy coming online,10
3054,"in our supply chain,",10
3055,and then our last piece,10
3056,will be to convert the energy,10
3057,that our customers use,10
3058,to charge our devices,10
3059,to clean energy.,10
3060,LO: What are some of the biggest changes,10
3061,that Apple's going to need to make,10
3062,in its business operations,10
3063,in order to be able,10
3064,to achieve those goals?,10
3065,LJ: So imagine if instead,10
3066,of mining material,10
3067,"to go into Apple products,",10
3068,we actually started,10
3069,with recycled material.,10
3070,So we're not going all the way,10
3071,back to the mine,10
3074,"Instead, we're really talking",10
3075,about reprocessing to some degree,10
3076,and putting that material,10
3077,right back into products —,10
3078,super important with things,10
3079,like conflict metals or rare earths.,10
3080,So Apple has been doing that work,10
3081,now for several years.,10
3082,We've actually promised,10
3083,that we want to make all of our products,10
3084,out of recycled and renewable materials.,10
3085,And so that investment,10
3086,also means we get to take away,10
3087,all the carbon emissions,10
3088,associated with everything up until,10
3089,the point of the recycled material.,10
3090,LO: So it strikes me that you actually,10
3091,hold a really interesting perspective.,10
3092,"You know, you're now at Apple",10
3093,"and, like, deep in the business world",10
3094,"around these things,",10
3095,"but formerly, you actually led",10
3096,the US Environmental Protection Agency,10
3097,"under the Obama administration,",10
3098,so you've seen,10
3099,the government side as well.,10
3100,"What, in your mind, is the right way",10
3101,to look at the respective roles,10
3102,of the state and the market,10
3103,in fighting the climate crisis?,10
3104,LJ: I don't think there's anything,10
3105,that business can do,10
3106,that replaces the role,10
3107,of government and leadership.,10
3108,"Yes, I ran the EPA,",10
3109,but the other part of my history is,10
3110,I worked there almost 20 years,10
3111,before I became the head of the EPA.,10
3112,"And you see firsthand, right,",10
3113,that only government is really charged,10
3114,with protecting its citizens.,10
3115,"We always think protection,",10
3116,"and we think the military,",10
3117,but I think the protection,10
3118,of the Environmental Protection Agency,10
3119,or the Air Quality Board in California,10
3120,or a local health department,10
3121,is as important to the day-to-day life,10
3122,of the people in that jurisdiction,10
3123,as anything that the other security-type,10
3124,protection can provide.,10
3125,"Now, business is a different story.",10
3126,I think business has an incredibly,10
3127,"important role to play in leading,",10
3128,especially at this time.,10
3129,So when Apple said,10
3130,its goal is 2030 carbon neutral —,10
3131,obviously the UN is saying,10
3132,2050 carbon neutral —,10
3133,we decided to challenge ourselves,10
3134,to go as fast as we could possibly do it,10
3135,so that other businesses,10
3136,"wouldn't have an excuse to say,",10
3137,"""""I need longer.",10
3138,"I need much, much longer.""""",10
3139,I think it's great to see this moment,10
3140,where suddenly there seems,10
3141,to be a realization,10
3142,that climate change policy,10
3143,"cannot be foisted on others,",10
3144,"but that, in fact, it has to be organic,",10
3145,"you know, for lack of a better word.",10
3146,And it's not an either-or.,10
3147,"It's always been this weird, you know,",10
3148,belief that we're taught from little,10
3149,that you can either be successful,10
3150,or you can do the right thing.,10
3151,There's no difference between the two;,10
3152,it's a false choice.,10
3153,LO: Although a lot of us have been talking,10
3154,"about justice for some time,",10
3155,it is only recently that I think,10
3156,this idea of justice as it relates,10
3157,to the environment and climate,10
3158,is making appearance,10
3159,in a forum such as this.,10
3160,You've personally described,10
3161,systemic racism and climate change,10
3162,"as interconnected issues,",10
3163,and I think it would,10
3164,be great to hear more.,10
3165,"LJ: To me, they're just the same thing.",10
3166,There is no climate justice,10
3167,without real justice.,10
3168,There is no climate change remedy,10
3169,that is going to be made and stick,10
3170,that doesn't involve justice.,10
3171,"And sometimes, more and more,",10
3172,I'm starting to think,10
3173,"that we shouldn't attack climate change,",10
3174,"we should attack justice and injustice,",10
3175,"and if we did, climate change",10
3176,would take care of itself.,10
3177,"For me, it's always come down to",10
3178,restoring people to the center,10
3179,of the discussion of solutions,10
3180,and restoring representation,10
3181,for the communities,10
3182,most impacted by climate change,10
3183,at the table of solution-making.,10
3184,"LO: Well, thank you. I appreciate it.",10
3185,It's been a real pleasure,10
3186,"to speak with you today,",10
3187,and I look forward to seeing,10
3188,how you advanced the efforts,10
3189,you talked about.,10
3190,LJ: And thank you,10
3191,for the voice you've been.,10
3192,I think it's super important,10
3193,"that leadership look like us,",10
3194,but also sound like you.,10
3195,So thank you.,10
3196,"John Doerr: Hello, Hal!",11
3197,"Hal Harvey: John, nice to see you.",11
3198,JD: Nice to see you too.,11
3199,"HH: So John, we've got a big challenge.",11
3200,We need to get carbon,11
3201,out of the atmosphere.,11
3202,"We need to stop emitting carbon,",11
3203,drive it to zero by 2050.,11
3204,And we need to be halfway there by 2030.,11
3205,Where are we now?,11
3206,"JD: As you know,",11
3207,we're dumping 55 billion tons,11
3208,of carbon pollution in our precious,11
3209,"atmosphere every year,",11
3210,as if it's some kind,11
3211,of free and open sewer.,11
3212,"To get halfway to zero by 2030,",11
3213,we're going to have to reduce,11
3215,by about 10 percent a year.,11
3216,And we've never reduced,11
3217,annual emissions in any year,11
3218,in the history of the planet.,11
3219,So let's break this down.,11
3220,Seventy-five percent of the emissions,11
3221,come from the 20 largest,11
3223,And from four sectors of their economy.,11
3224,The first is grid.,11
3226,The third from the buildings.,11
3227,And the fourth from industrial activities.,11
3228,"We've got to fix all those,",11
3229,at speed and at scale.,11
3230,HH: We do.,11
3231,And matters are in some ways worse,11
3232,than we think and some ways better.,11
3233,Let me start with the worse.,11
3234,Climate change is a wicked problem.,11
3235,And what do I mean by wicked problem?,11
3236,It means it's a problem,11
3237,that transcends geographic boundaries.,11
3238,"The sources are everywhere,",11
3239,and the impacts are everywhere.,11
3240,Although obviously some nations,11
3241,have contributed much more than others.,11
3242,"In fact, one of the terrible things",11
3243,about climate change,11
3244,is those who contributed,11
3245,least to it will be hurt the most.,11
3246,It's a great inequity machine.,11
3247,So here we have a problem,11
3248,that you cannot solve,11
3249,within the national boundaries,11
3250,"of one country,",11
3251,and yet international institutions,11
3252,are notoriously weak.,11
3253,So that's part of the wicked problem.,11
3254,The second element of the wicked problem,11
3255,is it transcends normal timescales.,11
3256,"We're used to news day by day,",11
3257,or quarterly reports,11
3258,"for business enterprises,",11
3259,or an election cycle — that's,11
3260,about the longest we think anymore of.,11
3261,Climate change essentially lasts forever.,11
3262,When you put carbon dioxide,11
3263,"into the atmosphere,",11
3264,"it's there, or its impacts",11
3265,"are there, for 1,000 years.",11
3266,It's a gift we keep on giving,11
3267,"for our children, our grandchildren",11
3268,and dozens and dozens,11
3269,of generations beyond there.,11
3270,JD: It sounds like a tax,11
3271,we keep on paying.,11
3272,"HH: Yeah, it is. It is.",11
3273,"You sin once, you pay forever.",11
3274,And then the third element,11
3275,of it being a wicked problem,11
3276,is that carbon dioxide is embedded,11
3277,in every aspect of our industrial economy.,11
3278,"Every car, and every truck,",11
3279,"and every airplane, and every house,",11
3280,"and every electrical socket,",11
3281,and every industrial processes,11
3282,now emits carbon dioxide.,11
3283,JD: So what's the recipe?,11
3284,"HH: Well, here's the shortcut.",11
3285,"If you decarbonize the grid,",11
3286,"the electrical grid,",11
3287,and then run everything on electricity —,11
3288,decarbonize the grid,11
3289,and electrify everything —,11
3290,"if you do those two things,",11
3291,you have a zero carbon economy.,11
3292,"Now, that would seem like a pipe dream",11
3293,just a few years ago,11
3294,because it was expensive,11
3295,to create a zero-carbon grid.,11
3296,But the prices of solar,11
3297,and wind have plummeted.,11
3298,Solar's now the cheapest,11
3299,form of electricity on planet earth,11
3300,and wind is second.,11
3301,It means now that you can convert,11
3302,the grid to zero-carbon rapidly,11
3303,and save consumers money along the way.,11
3304,So there's leverage.,11
3305,"JD: Well, I think a key question, Hal,",11
3306,is do we have the technology that we need,11
3307,to replace fossil fuels,11
3308,to get this job done?,11
3309,And my answer is no.,11
3310,"I think we're about 70,",11
3311,maybe 80 percent of the way there.,11
3312,"For example, we urgently need",11
3313,a breakthrough in batteries.,11
3314,Our batteries need to be,11
3315,higher energy density.,11
3316,They need to have enhanced,11
3317,"safety, faster charging.",11
3318,They need to take less space,11
3319,"and less weight,",11
3320,"and above all else,",11
3321,they need to cost a lot less.,11
3322,"In fact, we need new chemistries",11
3323,that don't rely on scarce cobalt.,11
3324,And we're going to need,11
3325,lots of these batteries.,11
3326,We desperately need much more research,11
3327,in clean energy technology.,11
3328,The US invests about,11
3329,2.5 billion dollars a year.,11
3330,Do you know how much,11
3331,Americans spend on potato chips?,11
3333,JD: The answer is 4 billion dollars.,11
3334,"Now, what do you think of that?",11
3335,HH: Upside down.,11
3336,But let me press a little further,11
3337,on a question that's fascinated me,11
3338,about the Silicon Valley.,11
3339,So the Silicon Valley,11
3340,"is governed by Moore's law,",11
3341,where performance doubles,11
3342,every 18 months.,11
3343,"It's not really a law,",11
3344,"it's an observation,",11
3345,but be that as it may.,11
3346,The energy world is governed,11
3347,"by much more mundane laws,",11
3348,"the laws of thermodynamics, right?",11
3349,It's physical stuff in the economy.,11
3350,"Cement, trucks, factories, power plants.",11
3351,"JD: Atoms, not bits.",11
3352,"HH: Atoms, not bits. Perfect.",11
3353,And the transformation,11
3354,"of big physical things is slower,",11
3355,"and the margins are worse,",11
3356,and often the commodities are generic.,11
3357,How do we stimulate,11
3358,the kind of innovation in those worlds,11
3359,that we actually need,11
3360,in order to save this planet earth?,11
3361,"JD: Well, that's a really great question.",11
3362,The innovation starts with basic science,11
3363,in research and development.,11
3364,"And the American commitment to that,",11
3365,"while advanced on a global sense,",11
3366,is still paltry.,11
3367,It needs to be 10 times higher,11
3368,"than the, say, 2.5 billion per year",11
3369,that we spend on clean energy R and D.,11
3370,But we need to go beyond R and D as well.,11
3371,"There needs to be a kind of development,",11
3372,"a kind of pre-commercialization,",11
3373,which in the US is done,11
3374,by a group called ARPA-E.,11
3375,Then there's the matter,11
3376,of forming new companies.,11
3378,JD: And I think entrepreneurial energy,11
3379,is shifting back into that field.,11
3380,It's clear that it takes longer,11
3381,"and more capital,",11
3382,but you can build a really substantial,11
3383,and valuable enterprise or company.,11
3385,JD: Tesla's a prime example.,11
3386,Beyond Meat is another one.,11
3387,And that's inspiring,11
3389,But that's not enough.,11
3390,"I think you need also a demand signal,",11
3391,"in the form of policies and purchases,",11
3392,"from nations, like Germany did with solar,",11
3393,to go make these markets happen.,11
3394,"And so I'm, at heart, a capitalist.",11
3395,I think this energy crisis,11
3396,is the mother of all markets.,11
3397,And it will take longer.,11
3398,But the market for electric vehicle,11
3399,batteries — 500 billion dollars a year.,11
3400,It's probably another 500 billion dollars,11
3401,if you go to stationary batteries.,11
3402,I want to tell you another story,11
3403,"that involves policy,",11
3404,"but importantly, plans.",11
3405,"Now, Shenzhen is a city",11
3406,"of 15 million people,",11
3407,"an innovative city, in China.",11
3408,And they decided that they were,11
3409,going to move to electric buses.,11
3410,And so they required,11
3411,all buses be electric.,11
3412,"In fact, they required parking spots",11
3413,have chargers associated with them.,11
3414,"So today, Shenzhen",11
3415,"has 18,000 electric buses.",11
3416,"It has 21,000 electric taxis.",11
3417,And this goodness didn't just happen.,11
3418,"It was the result of a thoughtful,",11
3419,"written, five-year plan",11
3420,that isn't just,11
3421,a kind of campaign promise.,11
3422,Executing against these plans,11
3423,"is how mayors get promoted, or fired.",11
3424,And so it's really deadly serious.,11
3425,"It has to do with carbon,",11
3426,"and it has to do with health, with jobs,",11
3427,and with overall economic strength.,11
3428,The bottom line is that China today,11
3429,"has 420,000 electric buses.",11
3430,"America has less than 1,000.",11
3431,So what other national projects are there,11
3432,that you'd like to see?,11
3433,"HH: So this is a global effort,",11
3434,but not everybody's,11
3435,"going to do the same thing,",11
3436,or should do the same thing.,11
3437,Let me start with Norway.,11
3438,A country that happens to be,11
3439,"brilliant at offshore oil,",11
3440,but also understands,11
3441,the consequences of burning more oil.,11
3442,They realized they could,11
3443,deploy their skills,11
3444,from their offshore oil development,11
3445,into offshore wind.,11
3446,It's a big deal to put wind,11
3447,turbines out in the ocean.,11
3448,"The ocean, the winds are much stronger,",11
3449,and the winds are much more,11
3450,"constant, not only stronger.",11
3451,So it balances the grid beautifully.,11
3452,But it's really hard to build things,11
3453,in the deep ocean.,11
3454,Norway's good at it.,11
3455,So let them take that on.,11
3456,JD: Are they taking it on?,11
3457,HH: They are actually.,11
3458,Yeah. It's pretty brilliant.,11
3459,Another example: India.,11
3460,There are hundreds of millions,11
3461,of people in India,11
3462,that don’t have access to electricity.,11
3463,With the advances in solar,11
3464,"and advances in batteries,",11
3465,there's no reason,11
3466,they have to build the grid,11
3467,to all those villages,11
3468,that don't have a grid.,11
3469,Skip the steps.,11
3470,Skip the dirty steps. Leapfrog to clean.,11
3471,"But this all comes together,",11
3472,"in my opinion, in the realm of policy.",11
3473,"We need dramatic accelerants,",11
3474,is what you're saying.,11
3475,"Accelerants in R and D,",11
3476,but also accelerants in deployment.,11
3477,Deployment is innovation,11
3478,because deployment drives prices down.,11
3479,"The right policy can turn things around,",11
3480,and we've seen it happen already,11
3481,in the electricity sector.,11
3482,So electricity regulators have asked,11
3483,for ever cleaner sources of electricity:,11
3485,"less coal, less natural gas.",11
3486,And it's working.,11
3487,"It's working pretty brilliantly, actually.",11
3488,But it's not enough.,11
3489,So the German government,11
3490,recognized the possibility,11
3491,of driving down the price of clean energy.,11
3492,And so they put in orders on the books.,11
3493,They agreed to pay an extra price,11
3494,"for early phases of solar energy,",11
3495,presuming the price would drop.,11
3496,They created the demand,11
3497,signal using policy.,11
3498,The Chinese created,11
3499,"a supply signal, also using policy.",11
3500,They decided that solar was a strategic,11
3501,part of their future economy.,11
3502,So you had this unwritten agreement,11
3503,"between the two countries,",11
3504,"one buying a lot,",11
3505,"the other producing a lot,",11
3506,that helped drive,11
3507,the price down 80 percent.,11
3508,We should be doing that,11
3509,"with 10 technologies, or a dozen,",11
3510,around the world.,11
3511,We need policy as the magic sauce,11
3512,to go through those four sectors,11
3513,"in the biggest countries,",11
3514,in all countries.,11
3515,And one of the things that animates me,11
3516,is that this requires people,11
3517,"who are concerned about climate change,",11
3518,"which should be everybody,",11
3519,those folks have to apply their energies,11
3520,on the policies that matter,11
3521,with the decision-makers who matter.,11
3522,If you don't know,11
3523,who the decision-maker is,11
3524,"to decarbonize the grid,",11
3525,or to produce electric vehicles,11
3526,"in the policy world,",11
3527,you're really not in the game.,11
3528,"JD: Hal, you're an expert in policy.",11
3529,I know this because I've read your book —,11
3530,"HH: Thanks, John.",11
3531,JD: Designing Climate Solutions.,11
3532,What makes for good policy?,11
3533,"HH: There are some secrets here,",11
3534,and they're really important,11
3535,if we want to solve climate change.,11
3536,Let me give you two of the secrets.,11
3537,"First, you have to go where the tons are.",11
3538,JD: Follow the tons.,11
3539,HH: Follow the tons.,11
3540,"And this is such an obvious idea,",11
3541,but it's amazing how many policies,11
3542,tinker around the edges.,11
3543,I call it green paint.,11
3544,We don't need green paint.,11
3545,We need green substance.,11
3546,"The second thing is when you set a policy,",11
3547,insist on continuous improvement.,11
3548,So what does that mean?,11
3549,"Back in 1978, Jerry Brown was the youngest",11
3550,"governor in California's history,",11
3551,and he implemented,11
3552,"a thermal building code,",11
3553,"which means when you build a building,",11
3554,it has to have insulation in it.,11
3555,Pretty simple idea.,11
3556,But he put a trick into that law.,11
3557,"He said every three years, the code",11
3558,"gets tighter, and tighter, and tighter.",11
3559,And how do you know how much tighter?,11
3560,Anything that pays for itself in energy,11
3561,savings gets thrown into the code.,11
3562,"So in the intervening years,",11
3563,"we got better insulation,",11
3564,"better windows, better furnaces,",11
3566,"Today, a new California building",11
3567,uses 80 percent less energy,11
3568,than a pre-code building.,11
3569,And Jerry Brown used his legislative,11
3570,bandwidth once to draft that policy,11
3571,that produces fruits forever.,11
3572,JD: He got the words right.,11
3573,HH: He got the words right.,11
3575,"There's a counterexample,",11
3576,which should be instructive as well.,11
3577,So you and I are both of an age,11
3578,where we remember the first oil embargo,11
3579,and the energy crisis that caused,11
3580,with stagnation and inflation,11
3581,at the same time.,11
3582,Gerald Ford was president.,11
3583,And he realized that if we could double,11
3584,"the fuel efficiency of new vehicles,",11
3585,we could cut in half their energy use.,11
3586,So he signed a law,11
3587,to double the fuel efficiency,11
3588,"of new vehicles sold in America,",11
3589,"from 13 miles per gallon,",11
3591,to 26 miles per gallon.,11
3592,JD: That's big.,11
3593,"HH: It’s pathetic by today’s standards,",11
3594,"but it was a big deal then, right?",11
3595,It was doubling.,11
3596,"But by setting a number as the goal,",11
3597,we created a 25-year plateau.,11
3598,So imagine if instead he said,11
3599,fuel efficiency will increase,11
3600,at four percent a year forever.,11
3601,"JD: So Hal, goals are great things.",11
3602,How do you find the policymakers,11
3603,that set these goals?,11
3604,And then how do you influence them?,11
3605,"HH: Well, so that's maybe",11
3606,the most important question of all.,11
3607,If we have a lot of concern,11
3608,"about climate change,",11
3609,"and not it's properly aimed,",11
3610,it just dissipates.,11
3611,It's a one-day headline about a march.,11
3612,And that's not going to get the job done.,11
3613,"In every sector, in every country,",11
3614,there’s a decision-maker.,11
3615,And it’s usually not the senator,11
3616,or the president.,11
3617,It’s usually an air quality regulator,11
3618,or a public utilities commissioner.,11
3619,These are the people,11
3620,that have the secret knobs,11
3621,on the energy of the economy.,11
3622,They're the ones that get to decide,11
3623,"whether we get cleaner and cleaner energy,",11
3624,"more and more efficient buildings,",11
3625,"more and more efficient cars,",11
3626,and so forth.,11
3627,JD: How many of these people are there,11
3628,in an economy like the US?,11
3629,"HH: Electric utilities are monopolies,",11
3630,and so they're regulated,11
3631,by utilities commissions.,11
3632,Otherwise they'd jack up,11
3633,the price too high.,11
3634,"Every state has a utilities commission,",11
3635,a public utilities commission.,11
3637,typically have five members.,11
3638,So that’s about 250 people in America,11
3639,who control the future of our grid.,11
3640,None of them's a senator.,11
3641,None of them's a governor.,11
3642,They're appointed positions.,11
3643,JD: How much carbon do they control?,11
3644,HH: 40 percent of the carbon,11
3645,in the economy.,11
3646,JD: Wow. 250 people.,11
3647,HH: 250 individuals.,11
3648,"Now, you can narrow that down even more.",11
3649,So let's go for the 30 biggest states.,11
3650,"Because this is all about tons, right?",11
3652,HH: You're now down to 150 individuals.,11
3653,And if you're content to win votes,11
3654,"on a three to two basis,",11
3655,you're down to 90 individuals who control,11
3656,almost half the carbon in the economy.,11
3657,How do you make sure those 90 people,11
3658,vote for a clean energy grid?,11
3659,They have a quasi-judicial process.,11
3660,They hold hearings.,11
3661,They take evidence.,11
3662,They consider what they're allowed to do,11
3663,within their statutory framework.,11
3664,And then they make a decision.,11
3665,"They have to look at human health,",11
3666,"at economics, at reliability.",11
3667,And they have to look at greenhouse gases.,11
3668,JD: Is there a breakthrough,11
3669,you’d like to see,11
3670,or an innovation,11
3671,you’re particularly excited about?,11
3672,HH: I'm keen on green hydrogen.,11
3673,"I mean, we need to drive down",11
3674,"the cost of electrolysis,",11
3675,and it's always going to be more expensive,11
3676,than just pure electricity.,11
3677,That's a thermodynamic certainty.,11
3678,"But once you have hydrogen,",11
3679,you can reform it with other,11
3680,"chemicals into liquid fuels,",11
3681,like synthetic diesel for airplanes,11
3682,or long haul trucks or ships.,11
3683,You can use it to make fertilizers.,11
3684,And we can rethink,11
3685,the basics of chemistry.,11
3686,"Chemistry's built on hydrocarbons,",11
3687,and we need to build it,11
3688,on carbohydrates instead.,11
3689,"So different kinds of molecules,",11
3690,but it’s not impossible.,11
3691,I guess the other thing,11
3692,that’s fascinating to me,11
3693,"is this term """"stranded investment.""""",11
3694,So if you own a coal-fired power plant,11
3695,"or a coal mine today,",11
3696,"anywhere in the world almost,",11
3697,you have stranded your money.,11
3698,You can't get it back.,11
3699,Because they're uneconomic.,11
3700,"We analyzed every coal plant in America,",11
3701,"the economics of every one,",11
3702,"and 75 percent of them,",11
3703,it's cheaper to shut them down,11
3704,and replace them with a brand new,11
3705,wind or solar farm,11
3706,than just pay the operating costs,11
3707,of that coal plant.,11
3708,So what's going to get stranded next?,11
3709,This is an important question.,11
3710,I think natural gas is next.,11
3711,It's already skidding along at low prices.,11
3712,I think people who are putting,11
3713,"a lot of money into gas fields right now,",11
3714,"or gas turbines right now,",11
3715,are going to rue the day.,11
3716,"John, what are some of",11
3717,the innovations or breakthroughs,11
3718,that you’re especially excited about?,11
3719,"JD: Well, one exciting development",11
3720,"comes from my friend and hero Al Gore,",11
3721,who has the vision,11
3722,"and is working with entrepreneurs,",11
3723,"that by integrating data can produce,",11
3724,"for every place on the planet,",11
3725,a new real-time estimate,11
3726,of what their carbon emissions are.,11
3727,"You know, I come from the school",11
3728,of measuring what matters.,11
3729,HH: Yes you do.,11
3730,JD: If we had a real-time,11
3731,"kind of Google Earth,",11
3732,where we could zoom in,11
3733,"to individual factories, or oil fields,",11
3734,"or Walmart stores,",11
3735,I think that could really change the game.,11
3736,I'm also a believer in carbon accounting.,11
3737,And so I've seen entrepreneurs,11
3738,who are making systems,11
3739,that will allow not just the owners,11
3740,but all the employees,11
3741,of an enterprise or organization,11
3742,to see what's in,11
3743,their carbon supply chain.,11
3744,HH: Yup. Yup.,11
3745,JD: I'd love to see legislation,11
3746,that required the OMB,11
3747,score every piece of legislation,11
3748,for its carbon impact.,11
3750,"JD: If we're serious about this,",11
3751,"we're going to measure what matters,",11
3752,measure what really matters.,11
3753,HH: Yup. Yup.,11
3754,JD: So let's talk about Paris,11
3755,and the Paris Accord,11
3756,because some people say that some,11
3757,"nations are ahead of their plans,",11
3758,"but others are not,",11
3759,and that the agenda,11
3760,is not aggressive enough.,11
3761,It’s not going to get us,11
3762,where we need to go.,11
3763,What is your view of the Paris Accords?,11
3764,HH: The Paris Accords,11
3765,are quite interesting animals.,11
3766,It’s not a national commitment,11
3767,and it’s not an international commitment.,11
3768,JD: They're not binding.,11
3769,HH: They're not binding.,11
3770,They're individually determined,11
3772,That’s the term of art,11
3773,that they use in the Paris Accord.,11
3774,JD: So what does that mean?,11
3775,HH: So that means Europe says:,11
3776,We're going to do 40 percent,11
3777,less carbon in 2030,11
3778,"than we did in 1990, for example.",11
3779,"If they fail to hit that number,",11
3780,there’s no consequences.,11
3781,"If they go past that number,",11
3782,there’s no consequences.,11
3783,"That, however, does that mean",11
3784,the Paris Accords are not important.,11
3785,They're really important.,11
3786,"Because they set up, I would call it,",11
3787,a race to the top,11
3788,instead of a race to the bottom.,11
3789,They set up a dynamic where people were,11
3790,sort of bidding to do better and better.,11
3791,They created transparency,11
3792,in how people are doing,11
3793,in terms of their carbon emissions.,11
3794,And there are some countries that take,11
3795,"these commitments very seriously,",11
3796,and including the European Union,11
3797,and China on that list.,11
3798,"JD: So I'm going to push on this,",11
3799,and what we really need,11
3801,is we need a plan.,11
3802,HH: So elaborate.,11
3803,"JD: Well, I think what we have today",11
3804,"are goals, not a plan.",11
3805,And I think a plan,11
3806,would be a set of 20 focused,11
3807,"precision policy efforts,",11
3808,each of whom's targeted,11
3809,"at the right decision-maker or makers,",11
3810,"in the right venues,",11
3811,"for these 20 largest nations,",11
3812,in the four sectors of their economy.,11
3813,And these precision campaigns,11
3814,"would be well-funded,",11
3815,"they'd be well-focused,",11
3816,"they'd have an awesome founder/CEO/leader,",11
3817,"an amazing staff of people,",11
3818,an accountable set of objectives,11
3819,"and key results,",11
3820,and be on a timeline.,11
3821,"We would measure their progress,",11
3822,quarter by quarter.,11
3823,That would give me hope that we'll get,11
3824,where we need to go by 2030.,11
3825,How about you?,11
3826,HH: Let me add on,11
3827,a couple of characteristics,11
3828,to exactly what you just said.,11
3829,And that is you need to have,11
3830,a deep understanding,11
3831,"of who the decision-maker is,",11
3832,"ideally by person, certainly by position,",11
3833,and understand exactly what motivates them,11
3834,or hinders them in making this decision,11
3835,so that you can put all your forces on,11
3836,the decision-maker at point of decision.,11
3837,It's one thing to have a general concern,11
3838,about the environment or about climate.,11
3839,It's quite another to focus that concern,11
3840,on the most important,11
3841,decisions on the planet.,11
3842,And that's what we need to do.,11
3843,I love this idea.,11
3844,"JD: Okay, so focus on the decision-makers.",11
3845,I think there's other individual action,11
3846,that we can and must take.,11
3847,We've got to amplify your voice,11
3848,"so that you organize, activate,",11
3849,"proselytize, your company,",11
3850,"your neighbors, youth, I think",11
3851,"are an incredibly powerful voice,",11
3854,JD: You need to vote.,11
3856,JD: You need to vote,11
3857,like your life depends on it.,11
3858,"So Hal, what does this all add up to?",11
3859,What's the takeaway?,11
3860,"HH: I'm an optimist, John.",11
3861,I've seen this possible.,11
3862,I've seen when nations,11
3863,"decide to do great things,",11
3864,they can do great things.,11
3865,Think of America’s rural electrification,11
3866,or the interstate highway system we built.,11
3867,Those are huge projects,11
3868,that transformed the country.,11
3869,What we did prepping for World War II:,11
3870,"we built 300,000 airplanes in four years.",11
3871,"So if we decide to do something,",11
3872,or when the Germans or the Chinese,11
3873,"or the Indians decide to do something,",11
3875,they can get it done.,11
3876,But if this is sort of,11
3877,"piffling around the edges,",11
3878,we won't get there.,11
3879,What do you think? Are you optimistic?,11
3880,"JD: My take on this is,",11
3881,"I may not be optimistic, but I'm hopeful.",11
3882,I really think the crucial question is:,11
3883,"Can we do what we must,",11
3884,at speed and at scale?,11
3885,"The good news is, it's now clearly cheaper",11
3886,to save the planet than to ruin it.,11
3887,"The bad news is,",11
3888,we are fast running out of time.,11
3889,"In the early months of the pandemic,",12
3890,chef José Andrés circulated two photos,12
3891,that have come to symbolize,12
3892,a modern American food crisis.,12
3893,The first shows mountains of potatoes,12
3894,that have been left to rot,12
3895,in a field in Idaho.,12
3896,The restaurants and cafeterias,12
3897,and stadiums that had consumed them,12
3898,were shuttered during the pandemic.,12
3899,The second shows a devastating scene,12
3900,outside of the San Antonio food bank.,12
3901,"Thousands of carloads of people lined up,",12
3902,waiting for food with not enough,12
3903,supply to go around.,12
3904,"""""How is it possible these two photos",12
3905,"exist at the same time,",12
3906,in the most prosperous,12
3907,and technologically advanced,12
3908,"moment in our history,"""" tweeted Andrés.",12
3909,In the months after,12
3910,"the photos were published,",12
3911,the crisis got worse.,12
3912,Billions of pounds of potatoes,12
3913,and other fresh produce,12
3914,were chucked by American farmers.,12
3915,"At the same time,",12
3916,food banks all over the country,12
3917,were reporting demand increases,12
3918,and 40 percent were facing,12
3920,"Outside the US,",12
3921,especially in the Middle East,12
3922,"and throughout Southeastern Africa,",12
3923,COVID-19 was paralyzing food systems,12
3924,that were already vulnerable.,12
3925,Oxfam has predicted,12
3926,that by the end of 2020,12
3927,"12,000 people per day could die",12
3928,of hunger related to COVID.,12
3929,That's more than the highest,12
3930,daily mortality rate,12
3931,recorded so far.,12
3932,But what's worse,12
3933,and what's much more,12
3934,concerning to all of us,12
3935,is that COVID is just one,12
3936,of many major disruptions,12
3937,that have been predicted,12
3938,in the years and decades ahead.,12
3939,More chronic and complex,12
3940,than the pressures of COVID,12
3941,are the pressures of climate change.,12
3942,And those of you who live in California,12
3943,have seen this on your farms.,12
3944,You've seen withering heat,12
3945,and drought and fires,12
3946,disrupt avocado and almond,12
3947,and citrus and strawberry farms.,12
3948,"This summer, we saw",12
3949,the devastating impacts of storms,12
3950,on corn and soy farms.,12
3951,I've seen the various,12
3952,"pressures of drought,",12
3953,"heat, flooding, superstorms,",12
3954,"invasive insects, bacterial blight,",12
3955,shifting seasons and weather volatility,12
3956,"from Washington to Florida,",12
3957,and from Guatemala to Australia.,12
3958,The upshot is this.,12
3959,Climate change is becoming,12
3960,something we can taste.,12
3961,This is a kitchen-table issue,12
3962,in the literal sense.,12
3963,The International Panel on Climate Change,12
3964,has predicted that by mid-century,12
3965,the world may reach a threshold,12
3966,of global warming,12
3967,beyond which current,12
3969,can no longer support,12
3970,large human civilizations.,12
3971,The USDA scientist Jerry Hatfield,12
3972,put it to me this way:,12
3973,the single biggest threat,12
3974,of climate change,12
3975,is the collapse of food systems.,12
3976,"The reality we face,",12
3977,one that was exposed,12
3978,by those mountains of potatoes,12
3979,"and the cars lined up during the pandemic,",12
3980,is that our supply chains are antiquated.,12
3981,Our food systems have not been designed,12
3982,to adapt to major disruptions,12
3983,or preempt them.,12
3984,Addressing this challenge,12
3985,as much as any other,12
3986,is going to define our progress,12
3987,in the coming century.,12
3988,But there's good news.,12
3989,And the good news is that farmers,12
3990,and entrepreneurs and academics,12
3991,are radically rethinking,12
3992,national and global food systems.,12
3993,They are marrying principles,12
3994,of old-world agroecology,12
3995,and state-of-the-art technologies,12
3996,to create what I call,12
3997,a third way to our food future.,12
3998,We're going to see radical changes,12
3999,in what we grow and how we eat,12
4000,"in the coming decades,",12
4001,as these environmental and population,12
4002,and public health pressures intensify.,12
4003,I studied these changes,12
4004,"for my book """"The Fate of Food:",12
4005,"What We'll Eat in a Bigger,",12
4006,"Hotter, Smarter World.""""",12
4007,I traveled for five years,12
4008,into the lands and the minds,12
4009,and the machines that are shaping,12
4010,the future of food.,12
4011,My travels took me,12
4012,"through 15 countries and 18 states,",12
4013,from apple orchards in Wisconsin,12
4014,"to tiny cornfields in Kenya,",12
4015,to massive Norwegian fish farms,12
4016,and computerized foodscapes in Shanghai.,12
4017,"I investigated new ideas,",12
4018,like robotics and CRISPR,12
4019,and vertical farms.,12
4020,"And old ideas, like edible insects",12
4021,and permaculture and ancient plants.,12
4022,I began to see the emergence,12
4023,of this third way to food production.,12
4024,A synthesis of the traditional,12
4025,and the radically new.,12
4026,There's a growing controversy,12
4027,about the best path,12
4028,to future food security in the US.,12
4029,"Food is ripe for reinvention,",12
4030,Bill Gates has proclaimed.,12
4031,Huge flows of investment,12
4032,are funding new methods of climate-smart,12
4033,and high-tech agriculture.,12
4034,But many sustainable food advocates,12
4035,bristle at this idea of reinvention.,12
4036,They want food deinvented.,12
4037,They argue for a return to preindustrial,12
4038,"and pre-green revolution,",12
4039,biodynamic and organic farming.,12
4040,"To which skeptics inevitably respond,",12
4041,"""""Nice, but does it scale?",12
4042,"Sure, a return to traditional",12
4044,"could produce better food,",12
4045,but can it produce enough food,12
4047,The rift between the reinvention camp,12
4048,and the deinvention camp,12
4049,has existed for decades.,12
4050,But now it's a raging battle.,12
4051,"One side covets the past,",12
4052,the other side covets the future,12
4053,and as someone observing this,12
4054,"from the outside,",12
4055,"I began to wonder,",12
4056,why must it be so binary?,12
4057,Can't there be a synthesis,12
4058,of the two approaches?,12
4059,Our challenge is to borrow,12
4060,"from the wisdom of the ages,",12
4061,"and from our most advanced science,",12
4062,to forge this third way.,12
4063,One that allows us,12
4064,"to improve and scale our harvests,",12
4065,while restoring rather than degrading,12
4066,the underlying web of life.,12
4067,I belong to neither camp.,12
4068,I'm a failed vegan,12
4069,"and a lapsed vegetarian,",12
4070,and a terrible backyard farmer.,12
4071,"If I'm honest,",12
4072,"I will keep trying at this,",12
4073,but I may fail.,12
4074,"But I'm hell-bent on hope,",12
4075,"and if my travels have taught me anything,",12
4076,it's that there's good reason for hope.,12
4077,Plenty of solutions are merging,12
4078,"that can help build sustainable,",12
4079,resilient food systems.,12
4080,Even if we can't rely on a critical mass,12
4081,of backyard-farming vegetarians,12
4082,"to do this on their own,",12
4083,from the ground up.,12
4084,Let's start with artificial,12
4085,intelligence and robotics.,12
4086,Jorge Heraud is a Peruvian-born engineer,12
4087,"who now lives in Silicon Valley,",12
4088,and his company developed,12
4089,"a robotic weeder named See and Spray,",12
4090,and I went to Arkansas to see,12
4091,the maiden voyage of See and Spray.,12
4092,And I was half expecting,12
4093,a battalion of C3PO-style robots,12
4094,to march into the fields,12
4095,with pincer hands to pluck the weeds.,12
4096,"And instead, I found this.",12
4097,"A tractor with a big, white",12
4098,hoop skirt off the back of it.,12
4099,And inside that hoop skirt are 24 cameras,12
4100,that use computer vision,12
4101,to see the ground beneath,12
4102,and to distinguish between,12
4103,the plants and the weeds.,12
4104,And to deploy with sniper-like precision,12
4105,these tiny jets,12
4106,"of concentrated fertilizer,",12
4108,that incinerate the baby weeds.,12
4109,I learned how robotics,12
4110,can end the practice,12
4111,of broadcast spraying chemicals,12
4112,across millions of acres of land,12
4113,and how we can reduce,12
4114,the use of herbicides,12
4115,by up to 90 percent.,12
4116,But the bigger picture,12
4117,is even more exciting.,12
4119,"can treat plants individually,",12
4120,applying not just herbicides,12
4121,but fungicides and insecticides,12
4122,"and fertilizers on a plant-by-plant,",12
4123,rather than field-by-field basis.,12
4124,"So that eventually,",12
4125,this kind of hyperspecific farming,12
4126,can allow for more diversity,12
4127,and intercropping on fields.,12
4128,And big farms can begin,12
4129,to mimic natural systems,12
4130,and improve soil health.,12
4131,Heraud is the embodiment,12
4132,"of third-way thinking, right?",12
4133,"Robots, he told me,",12
4134,"don't have to remove us from nature,",12
4135,"they can bring us closer to it,",12
4136,they can restore it.,12
4137,Increasing crop diversity will be crucial,12
4138,to building resilient food systems.,12
4139,And so will decentralizing agriculture,12
4140,so that when farmers,12
4141,"in one region are disrupted,",12
4142,"the others around, they can keep growing.",12
4143,"The rise of vertical farms,",12
4144,"like this farm, built inside",12
4145,"a former steel mill in Newark, New Jersey,",12
4146,can play a key role,12
4147,in decentralizing agriculture.,12
4148,Aeroponic farms use a tiny fraction,12
4149,of the water that is used,12
4150,in in-ground farms.,12
4151,"And they can grow food much faster,",12
4152,about 40 percent faster.,12
4153,"And when located in and near cities,",12
4154,"where the food is consumed,",12
4155,they eliminate a huge amount,12
4156,of trucking and food waste.,12
4157,It struck me at first as creepy,12
4158,"in kind of a """"Silent Running"""" way",12
4159,that we'd be growing,12
4160,our future fruits and vegetables,12
4161,"inside, without soil or sun.",12
4162,And after weeks of spending time,12
4163,"in these plant factories,",12
4164,"I began to see it as oddly,",12
4165,almost perfectly natural,12
4166,to deliver the plants,12
4167,"only and exactly what they need,",12
4168,with zero herbicides,12
4169,and radical efficiency.,12
4170,"Here again, we see innovators",12
4172,and perhaps even elevating,12
4173,the wisdom of natural ecosystems.,12
4174,Developments in plant-based,12
4175,and alternative meats,12
4176,are also profoundly hopeful.,12
4177,And they follow a similar trend,12
4178,"toward local, resilient,",12
4179,low-carbon protein production.,12
4180,"Consumers are excited about this,",12
4181,"and during the pandemic,",12
4182,we've seen a 250 percent increase,12
4183,in demand for alternative meats.,12
4184,A study by the Journal,12
4185,of Clinical Nutrition,12
4186,found that the participants,12
4187,who were eating the plant-based proteins,12
4188,"saw a drop in their cholesterol levels,",12
4189,in their weight,12
4190,"and eventually, a drop",12
4191,in their risk of heart disease.,12
4192,The potential environmental benefits,12
4193,of plant-based meats are astounding.,12
4194,And there's even potential,12
4195,in lab-grown or cell-based meats.,12
4196,Uma Valeti fed me my first plate,12
4197,"of lab-grown duck breast,",12
4198,harvested fresh from a bioreactor.,12
4199,It had been grown,12
4200,from a small sampling of cells,12
4201,taken from muscle tissue and fat,12
4202,"and connective tissues,",12
4203,which is exactly what we eat,12
4204,when we eat meat.,12
4205,This lab-grown or cell-based duck meat,12
4206,has very little threat,12
4207,"of bacterial contamination,",12
4208,it's about 85 percent lower CO2,12
4209,emissions associated with it.,12
4210,Eventually it can be grown,12
4211,like those crops inside vertical farms,12
4212,in decentralized facilities,12
4213,that aren't vulnerable,12
4214,to supply-chain disruptions.,12
4215,"Valeti started out as a cardiologist,",12
4216,who understood that doctors,12
4217,have been developing,12
4218,human and animal tissues,12
4219,in laboratories for decades.,12
4220,He was inspired as much by that,12
4221,as he was by a 1931 quote,12
4222,"from Winston Churchill that says,",12
4223,"""""We shall escape the absurdity",12
4224,of growing the whole chicken,12
4225,"in order to eat the breast or the wing,",12
4226,by growing them separately,12
4227,"in suitable mediums.""""",12
4228,"Like Heraud, Valeti is",12
4229,a quintessential third-way thinker.,12
4230,He's reimagined an old idea,12
4231,"using new technology,",12
4232,to usher in a solution,12
4233,whose time has come.,12
4234,I've met with dozens of farmers,12
4235,and entrepreneurs and engineers,12
4236,"who emulate third-way thinking,",12
4237,all over the world.,12
4238,They're using modern,12
4239,breeding tools like CRISPR,12
4240,to develop nutritious heirloom crops,12
4241,that can withstand drought and heat.,12
4242,They're using AI to make,12
4244,They're finding ways,12
4245,to eliminate food waste.,12
4246,They are scaling up,12
4248,and managed grazing.,12
4249,"And they're reviving ancient plants,",12
4250,and they're recycling,12
4251,sewage and gray water,12
4252,to develop a drought-proof water supply.,12
4253,The upshot is this:,12
4254,Human innovation that marries,12
4255,old and new approaches to food production,12
4256,"can, and I believe, will",12
4257,usher in this third way,12
4258,and redefine sustainable food,12
4259,on a grand scale.,12
4260,"One day, without warning",13
4261,"or apparent cause,",13
4262,all of humanity’s artificial satellites,13
4264,The first to understand the situation,13
4265,are a handful of government,13
4266,and commercial operators.,13
4267,But well before they have time,13
4268,"to process what’s happened,",13
4269,millions sitting on their couches become,13
4270,aware that something is amiss.,13
4271,TV that’s broadcast from or routed,13
4272,through satellites dominate the market,13
4273,for international programming,13
4274,"as well as some local channels,",13
4275,so the disappearance causes immediate,13
4277,The next people affected are those,13
4278,"traveling by air, sea, or land,",13
4279,"as global positioning, navigation",13
4280,"and timing services, have entirely ceased.",13
4281,"Pilots, captains, and drivers",13
4282,have to determine their locations,13
4283,using analog instruments and maps.,13
4284,"Aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles get",13
4285,"stopped, grounded, or returned to port.",13
4286,"In the meantime, air traffic controllers",13
4287,have a difficult task on their hands,13
4288,to prevent plane crashes.,13
4289,"Within hours, most of the planet’s traffic",13
4290,grinds to a halt.,13
4291,The effects aren’t limited,13
4292,to entertainment and travel.,13
4293,"All sorts of machines, from heating",13
4294,"and cooling systems to assembly lines,",13
4295,rely on super-accurate,13
4296,"satellite-based timing systems,",13
4297,and many have little-to-no backup options.,13
4298,Stoplights and other traffic control,13
4299,"systems stop synchronizing,",13
4300,so police and good Samaritans,13
4301,step in to direct the remaining cars,13
4302,and prevent as many accidents as possible.,13
4303,The most catastrophic impact,13
4304,is yet to come.,13
4305,"Because in the next few hours,",13
4306,the world economy shuts down.,13

4314,or make electronic payments.,13
4315,Logistics and supply chains for crucial,13
4316,"goods like food and medicine fragment,",13
4317,leaving people to survive on whatever,13
4318,is locally available.,13
4319,Most countries declare,13
4320,a state of emergency,13
4321,and call on the military to restore order.,13
4322,That may take quite a while.,13
4323,Most navigation and communication systems,13
4324,"are no longer operational,",13
4325,so military chains of command,13
4326,may be in disarray.,13
4327,"Many troops, including those actively",13
4328,"deployed, are left to their own devices.",13
4329,Commanders of nuclear submarines,13
4330,and missile control centers,13
4331,wonder if the disruption is the result,13
4332,of a hostile attack.,13
4333,What sorts of decisions do they make,13
4334,with partial information?,13
4335,"Even in the best-case scenario,",13
4336,our civilization gets set back by decades,13
4337,at the very least.,13
4338,"That’s because, despite",13
4339,"being a relatively new phenomenon,",13
4340,satellites have quickly replaced more,13
4341,traditional long range technologies.,13
4342,The combination of global positioning,13
4344,has allowed for near-instant signals,13
4345,that can be synchronized worldwide.,13
4346,Many systems we use daily,13
4347,have been built upon this foundation.,13
4348,Going back to the communication systems,13
4349,of the mid-20th century,13
4350,would not be a simple matter.,13
4351,"In many cases, they’d have to be rebuilt",13
4352,from the ground up.,13
4353,While the sudden disappearance,13
4354,"in this thought experiment is unlikely,",13
4355,there are two very real scenarios,13
4356,that could lead to the same results.,13
4357,The first is a solar flare so strong,13
4358,it fries satellite circuitry–,13
4359,as well as many other devices,13
4360,and power grids around the world.,13
4361,And the second is an orbital chain,13
4362,reaction of collisions.,13
4363,"With about 7,500 metric tons",13
4364,"of defunct spacecraft, spent boosters,",13
4365,and discarded equipment,13
4366,orbiting our planet,13
4367,at relative speeds,13
4368,"up to 56,000 kilometers per hour,",13
4369,even small objects can be,13
4371,A single collision in space could create,13
4372,"thousands of new pieces of debris,",13
4373,leading to a chain reaction.,13
4374,"Space is huge, but many of the thousands",13
4375,of satellites currently in orbit,13
4376,share the same orbital highways,13
4377,for their specific purposes.,13
4378,And since most objects sent to space,13
4379,"are not designed with disposal in mind,",13
4380,these highways only become,13
4381,more congested over time.,13
4382,"The good news is, we can protect ourselves",13
4383,"by studying our solar system,",13
4384,creating backup options,13
4385,"for our satellite networks,",13
4386,and cooperating to avoid,13
4387,an orbital tragedy of the commons.,13
4388,The space kilometers above our heads,13
4389,"is like our forests,",13
4390,the ocean’s biodiversity and clean air:,13
4391,"If we don't treat it as a finite resource,",13

4409,"to help them make better decisions,",14
4410,or help them be more efficient,14
4411,or help them communicate,14
4412,what they're doing better,14
4413,It's kind of mapping.,14
4414,"I mean, the way normal people",14

4439,that's the way I saw it.,14
4440,They were immigrants and they grew plants.,14

4450,because that's what design,14

4452,you see a problem,14
4453,"and you come up, creatively,",14
4454,with something that solves the problem.,14
4455,"And at Harvard,",14
4456,I started to get engaged,14
4457,with systems and computing.,14
4458,"And I realized, wow, this was in the '60s,",14
4459,"you know, when the environmental movement",14

4503,that people could use everywhere.,14
4504,"And the big idea of this product, Simone,",14
4505,was the integration of information,14
4506,using geographic principles.,14
4507,Bringing all the different,14
4509,"to not only first help us do the projects,",14
4510,but then build these systems,14
4511,"that help other people do the projects,",14
4512,and then later build systems.,14
4513,So we went from a project company,14
4514,to a product company,14
4515,that built systems that helped,14
4516,organizations do their work better.,14
4517,"SR: What you're doing, I believe,",14
4518,is sort of the integration,14
4519,of human and built systems,14
4520,with natural systems.,14
4521,And then helping people visualize that,14
4522,and figure out then how,14
4523,they can design and build for that,14
4524,"in a better, smarter way.",14
4525,Is that accurate?,14
4526,JD: That's one aspect of it.,14
4527,We sometimes call that geodesign.,14
4528,"We digitize or abstract geography,",14
4529,the science of our world.,14
4530,"You know, Simone, all of the factors",14
4531,"that you think about,",14
4532,I think of as layers.,14
4533,"Physical features, environmental features,",14
4535,We bring all of those things,14
4536,together in a GIS,14
4537,"and then by overlaying those things,",14
4538,we can actually do better designs.,14
4539,We design with all,14
4540,the factors holistically.,14
4541,"That's what actually,",14
4542,"as a student, got me excited,",14
4543,because I saw you could bring,14
4544,"all of the """"ologies,""""",14
4545,"all the geology, the sociology,",14
4546,"the climatology, all together,",14
4547,"and then make better decisions on that,",14
4548,so I think of geography,14
4549,"as the mother of all sciences,",14
4550,because it's an integrative technology.,14
4551,"And then digital geography,",14
4552,"what we call GIS,",14
4553,allows us to be able,14
4554,to use that instrument,14
4555,to empower the transformation,14
4556,of how people make decisions.,14
4557,"They can look at the whole,",14
4558,"not just one factor,",14
4559,"not just making money,",14
4560,"not just conserving land,",14
4561,not just this or that.,14
4562,It's optimizing many factors,14
4563,at the same time.,14
4564,"Yeah, so in the retail sector,",14
4565,people like Starbucks,14
4566,"or Walgreens or Walmart,",14
4567,"all the big retailers,",14
4568,"both here in the US but in the UK,",14
4569,"all around the world,",14
4570,use geographic factors,14
4571,to pick the right location.,14
4572,"They look at the demographics,",14
4574,and then the large insurance companies,14
4575,and reinsurance companies,14
4576,look at all the different factors,14
4577,that are necessary to understand risk.,14
4578,And they overlay them and they model them,14
4579,and they visualize high-risk areas,14
4580,or low-risk areas.,14
4581,"In disaster response,",14
4582,"whether it's fire, or like today,",14
4583,"the big earthquake in Turkey,",14
4584,there's a whole cycle of work,14
4585,that has to happen,14
4586,when disasters happen.,14
4587,"You know, response, recovery,",14
4588,all these work activities are underpinned,14
4589,by having good information.,14
4590,And that information,14
4591,is geographic in nature.,14
4592,"So disaster response, public safety,",14
4593,health and looking at issues today,14
4594,that are troubling all of us,14
4595,in the areas of social equity.,14
4596,Where is there disparity?,14
4597,And when something,14
4598,"like the pandemic happens,",14
4600,"due to the economy happens,",14
4601,we can look geographically and see,14
4602,these factors all coming together.,14
4603,So it's like your mind does in many ways.,14
4604,"I mean, we built a tool",14
4605,that allows you to abstract reality,14
4606,"and see it,",14
4607,and then look at all the relationships,14
4608,between these factors,14
4609,in order to create understanding.,14
4610,"So Richard Saul Wurman, the founder of TED",14
4611,often describes us,14
4612,as an understanding organization.,14
4613,"""""You're all about understanding, Jack,",14
4614,it's not about technology.,14
4615,Your users use your tools,14
4616,"to create better understanding.""""",14
4617,And the way he describes it is,14
4618,understanding precedes action.,14
4619,This is essential to our work.,14
4620,SR: And it is a platform,14
4621,"that you're building,",14
4622,so you're sort of connecting all these,14
4623,"different areas of knowledge, right?",14
4624,"JD: Today, we have what we call Web GIS.",14
4625,So GIS lives in the web,14
4626,with distributed centers of information,14
4627,"that are pulling data out,",14
4629,and using location as a way,14
4630,to do the integration.,14
4631,We might call it mashing up,14
4633,from distributed services,14
4634,or distributed sources of information.,14
4635,And our users are now bringing,14
4636,this knowledge together dynamically,14
4637,in things like smart cities,14
4638,or the popular vernacular,14
4639,these days is digital twins.,14
4640,So all of that geographic reality,14
4641,"can now be beamed into organizations,",14
4642,whether they be emergency,14
4644,or utility organizations or government.,14
4645,"And any of the different departments,",14
4646,whether they be law enforcement,14
4647,"or you know, science,",14
4648,"climate change, biodiversity,",14
4649,all of that series of issues,14
4650,that we're facing today,14
4651,can be enriched by not only bringing,14
4652,"together the information in real time,",14
4653,"real-time measurement seen on maps,",14
4654,but also integrating those,14
4655,like using spatial analysis,14
4656,or location analysis to look,14
4657,at the relationships and patterns.,14
4658,"You see, it's not just seeing it,",14
4659,it's also explicitly understanding,14
4660,the relationships between something,14
4661,like breast cancer and pollution,14
4662,that might exist,14
4663,in a particular geography.,14
4664,"And saying, """"Aha,",14
4665,we can quantitatively understand,14
4666,these different factors,14
4667,"and, as a result, respond.""""",14
4668,SR: So you can do that,14
4669,because you are putting,14
4670,all these different layers on,14
4671,and then you help visualize that.,14
4672,"JD: Visualize it,",14
4673,but also spatially relate them,14
4674,with math and modeling.,14
4675,So it's not just a matter,14
4676,"of visually overlaying material,",14
4677,it's a matter of connecting the geometries,14
4678,or the factors or the features,14
4679,"on these maps to each other,",14
4680,like your mind does.,14
4681,"SR: I have to read this,",14
4682,because I don't want to get it wrong.,14
4683,"You had said at some event last year,",14
4684,the Geodesign Summit —,14
4685,which sounds fascinating,14
4686,"to me — you said,",14
4687,"""""Transformation is not just about change,",14
4688,it's about leaving behind the past,14
4689,"to focus on the future.""""",14
4690,So can you talk a little bit about that?,14
4691,"JD: Historically, we have been",14
4692,at the effect of the environment.,14
4693,"I mean, this is the history of the world.",14
4694,The world constrains us,14
4695,in what we can do as human beings,14
4696,and we often adapt and adopt,14
4697,to various environmental situations.,14
4698,This field of geodesign,14
4699,is about bringing geographic,14
4700,systems and knowledge,14
4701,into the design process,14
4702,so that we can actually,14
4703,be guided by nature,14
4704,and be more sensitive to it,14
4705,so that we can be responsive,14
4706,to the greater forces of the environment,14
4707,and do it in such a way,14
4708,that we can take —,14
4709,it's thinking of the world as a garden.,14
4710,"It's like gardening,",14
4711,"you must pull out the weeds,",14
4712,"you nurture your plants,",14
4713,"you take care of certain things,",14
4714,you make sure things are watered.,14
4715,"And at this point,",14
4716,"because of the way we are organized,",14
4717,and the way we think,14
4718,and the way our information,14
4719,"is brought to us,",14
4720,"we don't think as a garden,",14
4721,"we don't think holistically,",14
4722,we don't think of the relationships,14
4723,"that are in our lives,",14
4724,that are affecting our lives.,14
4725,"And as a result, we're careless,",14
4726,"we're polluting the environment,",14
4727,we're messing it up.,14
4728,"I mean, on steroids,",14
4729,"I mean, the world is really in trouble",14
4730,at this particular point.,14
4731,"I mean we have the crisis of COVID,",14
4732,"but my God, COVID is just a little wave.",14
4733,What's coming behind us,14
4734,"is the climate change issue,",14
4735,which is not so easy to fix.,14
4736,There's no vaccine that's simply applied.,14
4737,"And then behind that,",14
4738,there's the loss of biodiversity,14
4739,"and behind that,",14
4740,it's sort of unraveling,14
4741,what has taken billions of years,14
4742,to be able to put together.,14
4743,"And so, as human beings,",14
4744,my sense is we've got to be,14
4745,more responsive to take care of our place.,14
4746,SR: It's transformation,14
4747,with science and design,14
4748,as opposed to transformation,14
4749,brought on or foisted on us,14
4750,by rapid tech change.,14
4751,It sounds very deliberate.,14
4752,JD: It's very deliberate.,14
4753,"Again, when I was a student,",14
4754,I got the vision or thought,14
4755,that we could actually do,14
4757,and design and development better,14
4758,by thinking holistically.,14
4759,Bringing all the factors together.,14
4760,"And when I launched Esri,",14
4761,we were starting to do projects better,14
4762,because we could integrate,14
4763,all of the factors,14
4764,into the design projects.,14
4765,"Then as we started building systems,",14
4766,"they were first small, focused systems",14
4767,"for a particular department,",14
4768,like an engineering department in a city,14
4769,"or a planning department,",14
4770,or a forest management organization,14
4771,or an oil company.,14
4772,They could do their work better,14
4773,by considering all the factors.,14
4775,And that transformed the way,14
4776,"projects were done,",14
4777,and it transformed human activities,14
4778,in these different departments.,14
4779,"From there, we started to move on",14
4780,to the idea of transforming,14
4782,This meant entire enterprises.,14
4783,So from projects to systems,14
4784,to organizational transformation,14
4785,where you could actually,14
4786,have organizations by intention,14
4787,look at all the factors.,14
4788,And we have so many examples of this.,14
4789,"And now, there's a fourth phase",14
4790,that we're very engaged in.,14
4791,Those three phases involve,14
4792,"certain kinds of technology innovation,",14
4793,but the fourth phase is resting on the web,14
4794,"with web services,",14
4795,and its intention is not to transform,14
4796,simply one organization at a time,14
4797,"or one project at a time,",14
4798,it's to transform society,14
4799,so that we can raise the bar,14
4800,with geographic consciousness,14
4801,and geographic knowledge,14
4802,to see what our human,14
4803,footprint is causing.,14
4804,"And this is so transformational,",14
4805,"because people don't want to mess up,",14
4806,they want to know what to do,14
4807,and they want to put the foot down,14
4808,"in the right location,",14
4809,they don't want to mess up,14
4810,"wetlands by intention,",14
4811,they want to design with nature.,14
4812,SR: So you're talking about what you call,14
4813,a geospatial nervous system.,14
4814,"JD: Yes, building",14
4815,a geospatial nervous system,14
4816,will allow us to guide,14
4817,society in such a way.,14
4818,"And in a way, it's not",14
4819,"somebody guiding others,",14
4820,it's not like that at all.,14
4821,It's like the internet itself.,14
4822,It's an interconnected network,14
4823,"of serving knowledge,",14
4825,and using each other's knowledge.,14
4826,"That is, multidisciplinary knowledge,",14
4827,different kinds of science knowledge,14
4828,to be able to see and understand,14
4830,All we're doing is building tools,14
4831,that interconnect different,14
4833,And independent actors,14
4834,running in independent organizations,14
4835,all around the world,14
4836,are building something I like to call,14
4837,this geospatial infrastructure.,14
4838,And they're layering it on top of the web.,14
4839,It's like one agency is serving,14
4841,and another one is able to use it,14
4842,with their own information,14
4843,"and therefore make better decisions,",14
4844,make more sustainable decisions.,14
4845,"Now, they're still all independent actors.",14
4846,"I mean, there's no control,",14
4847,there's no orders from headquarters.,14
4848,What this is is a fabric,14
4849,that's emerging very rapidly.,14
4850,Let me give a practical example.,14
4851,"The Pacific Gas and Electric corporation,",14
4852,a very large organization,14
4853,"here in California,",14
4854,"one of the largest utilities in the world,",14
4855,is sharing their outage,14
4856,and utility information over the web,14
4857,with the State of California fire people,14
4858,"and emergency management people,",14
4859,so that they can act better,14
4860,and vice versa.,14
4861,So they're sharing and collaborating,14
4862,through geographic information,14
4863,in whole new ways.,14
4864,"And the FEMA, the large federal",14
4865,emergency management organization,14
4866,is sharing their emergency,14
4868,with states and cities,14
4869,who are overlaying,14
4870,"their data on FEMA data,",14
4871,which is overlaying on top,14
4872,of NOAA's information on the weather,14
4873,"and the tracking of satellites, and so on.",14
4874,"So this web-based, internet-based system",14
4875,is allowing the fusion of information,14
4876,from many different actors.,14
4878,these actors are able to more,14
4879,holistically solve their problems.,14
4880,SR: Do you think we can overcome,14
4882,"JD: Today, both because",14
4883,of our increased consumption patterns,14
4884,"and the overpopulation of the planet,",14
4885,we're in severe trouble.,14
4886,"So what we can do is, I think,",14
4887,"minimize the impact of population,",14
4888,"we can optimize the work that we do,",14
4889,"we can save energy,",14
4890,we can do all of these various things.,14
4891,And I have a very positive,14
4892,feeling about the future.,14
4893,This is what drives me day and night.,14
4894,"I mean, I have had that vision",14
4895,for over 50 years,14
4896,that we must do this.,14
4897,"It's not a question of the outcomes,",14
4898,it's the only way that I can think of,14
4899,to create a sustainable future.,14
4900,"We must apply our best science,",14
4901,we must apply our best design,14
4902,"and critical thinking,",14
4903,"we must apply our best systems theories,",14
4904,"we must apply our best technologies,",14
4906,to be able to address the great challenges,14
4907,that we are all facing.,14
4908,"And Esri, as an organization,",14
4909,has always been and will always be,14
4910,all about bringing those forces together,14
4911,to be able to support,14
4913,doing their work,14
4914,in this more holistic way.,14
4915,That's the big vision.,14
4916,SR: So what advice or guidance,14
4917,would you give to a young,14
4919,"who, sort of, wants to use",14
4920,tech and science,14
4921,"to, you know, if not save the world,",14
4922,"transform the world or improve the world,",14
4923,"because obviously, that's where",14
4924,a lot of the hope and the potential is.,14
4925,So as someone who has been doing this,14
4926,"for quite some time now,",14
4927,what would your advice be,14
4928,to someone like that?,14
4929,"JD: Well, there's so many",14
4931,to be able to work,14
4932,and contribute in the world.,14
4933,I was very lucky with parents,14
4934,who were servants,14
4935,and they taught me,14
4936,to be in service to others.,14
4937,This was a great value gift.,14
4938,"When I went to Harvard,",14
4939,there was also a philosophy there,14
4940,"to be in public service,",14
4941,"to be able to focus your life,",14
4942,to be able to give back.,14
4943,And Harvard has been a huge contributor,14
4944,to those in public sector.,14
4945,"In the UK, Oxford and Cambridge",14
4946,had that same kind of philosophy,14
4947,of growing the next generation,14
4948,that's in public service.,14
4949,So I think service is one of the elements.,14
4950,The second one is really being,14
4951,about staying focused on your vision.,14
4952,"For me, my vision was this idea",14
4953,of bringing systems theories,14
4954,and science and technology together,14
4955,to be able to do better problem-solving.,14
4956,First with design,14
4957,and now whole organizations,14
4958,and society in general.,14
4959,"That didn't just happen,",14
4960,it was thoughtful time spent,14
4961,by myself and with my wife,14
4962,to think about what,14
4963,we should with our life.,14
4964,And we were really lucky.,14
4965,We found this great thing,14
4966,that we were passionate about.,14
4967,"We thought and visualized,",14
4968,"""""Yes, this is really something",14
4969,"we could actually do.""""",14
4970,"We had no idea where it would go,",14
4971,but at least we picked,14
4972,a segment of our interest,14
4973,to be able to follow this passion,14
4974,and we lucked out.,14
4975,"And we didn't sell out, we lucked out.",14
4976,We were very fortunate to live,14
4977,very modestly for several decades,14
4978,to build up this organization,14
4979,and stay focused on our purpose.,14
4980,"So my suggestion is,",14
4981,"find something that you really love,",14
4982,"that you really can contribute to,",14
4983,"that really supports your idealism,",14
4984,and don't sell out for money,14
4985,or venture capital,14
4986,"or borrow money,",14
4987,none of that actually winds up,14
4988,in being able to retain your idealism.,14
4989,SR: So I think there is so much happening,14
4990,on the intersection of tech,14
4991,and life science right now,14
4992,"that is so exciting,",14
4993,but also at this intersection,14
4994,"that you're talking about as well,",14
4995,"and very much, I think,",14
4996,will be part of the solutions,14
4997,for us going forward.,14
4998,JD: I think that this big step,14
4999,of Web GIS that we're into right now,14
5000,will happen over the next few years.,14
5001,"And it's, in some ways, just in time.",14
5002,"Like the UN has organized their SDGs,",14
5003,"these global sustainability issues,",14
5004,into this Web GIS platform.,14
5005,We're building a system which is bottom-up,14
5006,"and country by country,",14
5007,that allows all the SDG reporting,14
5008,"to be able to tell the world,",14
5009,"like they did with COVID,",14
5011,with the other 290 indicators.,14
5012,"Whether it's, you know, women in politics",14
5013,or whether it's loss of forests,14
5014,"or water quality,",14
5015,this is a big deal.,14
5016,So it isn't just organizations anymore.,14
5017,We're starting to see,14
5019,of the individual systems,14
5020,"into this system of systems,",14
5021,which I think can talk to the world,14
5022,and transform the world.,14
5023,This is essential,14
5024,if we are going to evolve,14
5025,to a society that's sustainable.,14
5027,I think that is a perfect place to stop.,14
5028,Thank you so much.,14
5029,This was really wonderful.,14
5030,"I'm really, really glad",14
5031,that we got to do this.,14
5032,I once watched this video of a relay race,15
5033,at a primary school in Jamaica.,15
5034,"You see here, there are two teams,",15
5035,the Yellow team and the Blue team.,15
5036,"And the kids are doing great,",15
5037,working so hard and running so fast.,15
5038,"And the Yellow team has the lead,",15
5039,until this little boy gets the baton,15
5040,and runs in the wrong direction.,15
5041,My favorite part,15
5042,"is when the grown-up chases him,",15
5043,"looking like he's about to pass out,",15
5044,trying to save the situation,15
5045,and get the kid to run,15
5046,in the right direction.,15
5047,"In many ways, that's what it's like",15
5048,for many young people in Africa.,15
5049,They're many paces behind their peers,15
5050,on the other side,15
5051,"of the inequality divide,",15
5052,and they're also running,15
5053,in the wrong direction.,15
5054,Because as much as we might,15
5056,and aspire to build,15
5057,economic and social systems,15
5058,"where it’s not the case,",15
5059,global development is a race.,15
5060,And it's a race,15
5061,"that my home country, Nigeria,",15
5062,"and home continent, Africa, are losing.",15
5063,Inequality must be seen,15
5064,as the global epidemic that it is.,15
5065,From the boy who cannot afford to dream,15
5066,because of the disappointment,15
5067,that could come with it,15
5068,to the girl that skips school,15
5069,"in order to sell snacks in traffic,",15
5070,just to fund her school fees.,15
5071,It is clear that inequality,15
5072,is at the center,15
5073,"of many of the world's problems,",15
5074,affecting not just the bottom,15
5075,"40 percent of us, but everyone.",15
5076,Young men and women,15
5077,who don't get set on the path,15
5078,of equal opportunities,15
5080,And we may not like the choices they make,15
5081,in their attempt to get,15
5082,what they think they rightly deserve,15
5083,or punish those that they assume,15
5084,keep them away,15
5085,from those better opportunities.,15
5086,But it doesn't have to be this way,15
5087,"if we, as humanity,",15
5088,make different choices.,15
5089,We have the ability we need,15
5090,"to fill that opportunity gap,",15
5091,but we just have to prioritize it.,15
5092,I grew up many paces behind.,15
5093,Even though I was a smart kid,15
5094,"growing up in Akure,",15
5095,"a town 350 kilometers from Lagos,",15
5096,it felt like a place that was disconnected,15
5097,"from the rest of the world,",15
5098,and one where hope,15
5099,and dreams were limited.,15
5100,"But I wanted to get ahead,",15
5101,and when I saw a computer,15
5102,"for the first time, in my high school,",15
5103,"I was spellbound,",15
5104,and I knew I just had to get my hands,15
5105,on whatever it was.,15
5106,"This was in 1991,",15
5107,and there were only two computers,15
5108,for the entire school,15
5109,of more than 500 students.,15
5110,So the teacher in charge said,15
5111,"computers were not for people like me,",15
5112,because I wouldn't understand,15
5113,how to use them.,15
5114,He would only allow my friend,15
5115,"and his two brothers,",15
5116,"sons of a professor of computer science,",15
5117,"to use it, because they already knew",15
5118,what they were doing.,15
5119,"In university, I was so desperate",15
5120,to be around computers,15
5121,that to make sure,15
5122,"I had access to the computer lab,",15
5123,"I slept there at night,",15
5124,even when the campus was closed,15
5125,due to teachers' strikes,15
5126,and student protests.,15
5127,I didn't own a computer,15
5128,"until I was gifted one in 2002,",15
5129,"but what I lacked in devices,",15
5130,I made up for in drive and determination.,15
5131,"However, camping out in computer labs",15
5132,in order to teach yourself coding,15
5133,"isn't a systemic solution,",15
5134,which is why I started,15
5136,to help all Nigerians,15
5137,learn to use technology,15
5138,to help them run faster and further,15
5139,"toward their hopes and dreams,",15
5140,and help our nation and take our continent,15
5141,great leaps forward in development.,15
5142,"You see, to put it as simply as possible,",15
5143,my goal is for everyone in Africa,15
5144,to become Famous'.,15
5145,"I don't mean, like, a celebrity,",15
5146,I mean I want everyone,15
5147,"to be like Famous, this guy.",15
5148,When Famous Onokurefe,15
5149,"came to Paradigm Initiative,",15
5150,"he had completed high school,",15
5151,"but couldn't afford college,",15
5152,and his options in life were limited.,15
5153,When I asked Famous recently,15
5154,about where he would have been,15
5155,"without our training program,",15
5156,"he rolled out a list of could-haves,",15
5157,"including ending up on the streets,",15
5158,"jobless and homeless,",15
5159,at the risk of doing things,15
5160,he wouldn't be proud of.,15
5161,"But luckily, Famous came",15
5162,"to Paradigm Initiative, in 2007,",15
5163,"because his friends, who were part",15
5164,"of a youth group I'd told about my plans,",15
5165,kept talking about a free,15
5166,computer training program.,15
5167,"And during his training,",15
5168,Famous paid close attention and excelled.,15
5169,When the United Kingdom,15
5170,Trade and Investment team,15
5171,at the UK Deputy High Commission in Lagos,15
5172,asked us to recommend,15
5173,"a few potential interns,",15
5174,we recommended Famous,15
5175,and a few others to be interviewed.,15
5176,"He got the internship,",15
5177,"and while there, he heard about",15
5178,an Entry Clearance Assistant job,15
5179,at the [British] High Commission in Abuja.,15
5180,"He applied, even though,",15
5181,"without a college degree,",15
5182,no one thought he had a shot.,15
5183,"He was starting behind,",15
5184,but it wasn't technology,15
5185,"that helped him get ahead,",15
5186,"it was the extra training,",15
5187,"training rooted in his community,",15
5188,training that understood,15
5189,"his context and his challenges,",15
5190,training that helped him,15
5191,change his life for the better.,15
5192,"Famous got the job,",15
5193,and then saved enough,15
5194,to pay his way through university.,15
5195,"Famous, a Medical",15
5197,"from Delta State University,",15
5198,is now a chartered accountant,15
5199,and an assistant manager,15
5200,with one of the world's Big Four,15
5201,"professional services firms,",15
5202,where he has won innovation awards,15
5203,consecutively for the last four years.,15
5204,But let's be clear ...,15
5205,the computer didn't do that — we did.,15
5206,Without our additional,15
5207,"training and support,",15
5208,Famous wouldn’t be where he is today.,15
5209,Fairness is not giving everyone,15
5210,"a computer and a special program,",15
5211,fairness is helping make sure everyone,15
5212,has the same access,15
5213,and training that can help them,15
5214,make use of all these things,15
5215,to improve their lives.,15
5216,"When people are further behind,",15
5217,fairness isn't giving everyone,15
5218,"the same opportunity to compete,",15
5219,fairness is helping those who are behind,15
5220,to get to the same starting line,15
5221,with everyone else,15
5222,and giving them a chance,15
5223,to run their own race,15
5224,in the right direction.,15
5225,Yet there are millions of young people,15
5226,who have not been as fortunate,15
5227,"as Famous and I,",15
5228,"who still don't have the skills,",15
5229,"let alone the will,",15
5230,to face similarly,15
5232,As more workers and students,15
5233,now have to complete tasks,15
5234,"or learn from home,",15
5236,"is exponentially pronounced,",15
5237,and with dire consequences.,15
5238,This is why I do what I do,15
5239,through Paradigm Initiative.,15
5240,"But just like many intervention programs,",15
5241,there's a limit to how many young people,15
5242,we can reach through our three centers.,15
5243,We've now taken the training,15
5244,"to where the kids are,",15
5245,but public schools are so ill-equipped,15
5246,"that we have to bring devices, access,",15
5247,"and in many cases,",15
5248,we have to provide power supply.,15
5249,"Since 2007, we've worked",15
5250,with young Nigerians,15
5251,in order to improve their lives,15
5252,and that of their families.,15
5253,"To give just one example,",15
5254,"Ogochukwu Obi father kicked her,",15
5255,"her sisters and her mom out,",15
5256,because he preferred to have a son.,15
5257,"But when she completed our program,",15
5258,got a job and became,15
5259,"her family's breadwinner,",15
5260,"her father came calling,",15
5261,admitting that he was wrong,15
5262,about the worth of the girl.,15
5263,In addition to our work,15
5264,"at our training centers and in schools,",15
5265,we're now planning to acquire,15
5266,"mobile learning units,",15
5267,"busses equipped with access,",15
5268,"with devices, and with power,",15
5269,and that can serve multiple schools.,15
5270,"Yes, we need better access to technology",15
5271,and policies that facilitate,15
5272,"open internet access,",15
5273,"freedom of expression and more,",15
5274,but the best computers in the world,15
5275,"could fall in a democratic forest,",15
5276,"but no one would hear them,",15
5277,"let alone use them,",15
5278,"if they were miles away,",15
5279,hauling water from a well,15
5280,or foraging for scrap metal,15
5281,to pay school fees,15
5282,in a school that can’t,15
5283,even teach them computer skills.,15
5284,Just like the fanciest,15
5285,sneakers in the world,15
5286,can’t help a runner,15
5287,miles behind everyone else.,15
5288,I'll never forget being invited,15
5289,back to my high school,15
5290,while I was Nigeria's Information,15
5291,Technology Youth Ambassador.,15
5292,It was 10 years after I had been denied,15
5293,access to using the computer,15
5294,in that very same school.,15
5295,"But here I was,",15
5296,being introduced as a role model,15
5297,who was supposedly shaped,15
5298,by the same school.,15
5299,"After my presentation,",15
5300,"that teacher, who said I could never",15
5301,"understand how to use computers,",15
5302,was quick to grab the microphone,15
5303,and tell everyone,15
5304,that he remembered me as a student,15
5305,and he was sure I had it in me all along.,15
5306,He was right.,15
5307,"He didn't know it at the time,",15
5308,but I did have it in me.,15
5309,"Famous had it in him,",15
5310,"Ogochukwu had it in her,",15
5311,the bottom 40 percent have it in them.,15
5312,Are we going to say,15
5313,that life-changing opportunities,15
5314,"are not for people like them,",15
5315,like that teacher said?,15
5316,Or are we going to recognize,15
5317,that centuries of inequality,15
5318,"can’t just be solved by gadgets,",15
5319,but by training and resources,15
5320,that fully level the playing field?,15
5321,Fairness is not about giving every child,15
5322,"a computer and an app,",15
5323,"fairness is connecting them to access,",15
5324,"to training and to additional support,",15
5325,for the need to take equal advantage,15
5326,of those computers and apps.,15
5327,That's how we pass them the baton,15
5328,and help them catch up,15
5329,"and start running in the right direction,",15
5330,and change their lives.,15
